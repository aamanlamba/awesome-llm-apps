I'm currently translating Matlab code to Python code and I often need to compare outputs of functions. In PyCharm's debugger, I can right click on a variable in the variable space and then press « View as array ». This gives me a nice grid view of my array (Excel kind of grid) and I can easily compare with my array in Matlab, which can also be displayed in a grid. However, sometimes, this option won't work in PyCharm and I don't know why! For example, I have a variable of type numpy.ndarray containing 137 by 60 floats and when I press « view as array », it displays the window, but instead of showing the grid, it shows « Nothing to show ». Curiously, I tried to copy the first 30 lines in another variable and this time PyCharm was able to show me the grid associated with this new variable. Usually, the number doesn't seem to be a problem. I tried to display a 500 by 500 array containing floats and it did just fine.\nIf someone could tell me why this happens and how I can overcome this problem, I'd be very glad. Also, if anyone has another way to display a matrix in Python in an elegant way, I'd take it too since it could also help me in my task! \nThanks!\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I encountered the same problem when I tried to view a complex arrays with 'Color' check box checked.

But I put both in the title to make it a general question. If you are editing this question, please feel free to remove one. Ok, here is my question,\nHere is an edit to the original question. Consider a Markov Chain with a 2 dimensional state vector x_t=(y_t,z_t) where y_t and z_t are both scalars. What is the best way of representing\/storing\/manipulating transition matrix of this Markov Chain?\nNow, what I explained is a simplified version of my problem. My Markov Chain state vector is a 5*1 vector. \nHope this clarifies\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Let's say you're trying to use a Markov chain to model english sentence syntax.  Your transition matrix will give you the probability of going from one part of speech to another part of speech.  Now let's suppose that we're using a 3rd-order Markov model.  This would give use the probability of going from state 123 to 23X, where X is a valid state. \nThe Markov transition matrix would be N3 x N, which is still a 2-dimensional matrix regardless of the dimensionality of the states, themselves.  If you're generating the probability distributions based on empirical evidence, then, in this case, there's going to be states with probability 0.  \nIf you're worried about sparsity, perhaps arrays are not the best choice.  Instead of using an array of arrays, perhaps you should use a dictionary of dictionaries.  Or if you have many transition matrices, an array of dictionaries of dictionaries.\nEDIT (based off comment):\nYou're right, that is more complicated.  Nonetheless, for any state, (i,j), there exists a probability distribution for going to the next state, (m,n).  Hence, we have our \"outer\" dictionary, whose keys are all the possible states.  Each key (state) points to a value that is a dictionary, which holds the probability distribution for that state.\n    "}

I built a ROC curve for my classifier, and it turns out that the optimal threshold for my training data is around 0.25. I'm assuming that the default threshold when creating predictions is 0.5. How can I change this default setting to find out what the accuracy is in my model when doing a 10-fold cross-validation? Basically, I want my model to predict a '1' for anyone greater than 0.25, not 0.5. I've been looking through all the documentation, and I can't seem to get anywhere.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>That is not a built-in feature. You can \"add\" it by wrapping the LogisticRegression class in your own class, and adding a threshold attribute which you use inside a custom predict() method.\nHowever, some cautions:\n\nThe default threshold is actually 0. LogisticRegression.decision_function() returns a signed distance to the selected separation hyperplane. If you are looking at predict_proba(), then you are looking at logit() of the hyperplane distance with a threshold of 0.5. But that's more expensive to compute.\nBy selecting the \"optimal\" threshold like this, you are utilizing information post-learning, which spoils your test set (i.e., your test or validation set no longer provides an unbiased estimate of out-of-sample error). You may therefore be inducing additional over-fitting unless you choose the threshold inside a cross-validation loop on your training set only, then use it and the trained classifier with your test set.\nConsider using class_weight if you have an unbalanced problem rather than manually setting the threshold. This should force the classifier to choose a hyperplane farther away from the class of serious interest.\n    "}

Thank you! \nAdded March 21: It looks like I didn't word my post appropriately. Sorry. What I'm trying to do is optimize the output of 10 different production units (given different speeds and amounts of downtime) for several scenarios. My goal is to place blocks of downtime to minimized the differences in production on a day-to-day basis. The amount of downtime and frequency each unit is allowed is given. I am currently trying to evaluate a three week cycle, meaning every three weeks each production unit is taken down for a given amount of hours. I was asking the computer to determine the order the units would be taken down based on the constraint that the lines come down only once every 3 weeks and the difference in daily production is the smallest possible. My first approach was to use Excel (as I tried to describe above) and it didn't work (no suprise there)... where 1- running, 0- off and when these are summed to calculate production. The calculated production is subtracted from a set max daily production. Then, these differences were compared going from Mon-Tues, Tues-Wed, etc for a three week time frame and minimized using solver. My next approach was to write a Matlab code where the input was a tolerance (set allowed variation day-to-day). Is there a program that already does this or an approach to do this easiest? It seems simple enough, but I'm still thinking through the different ways to go about this. Any insight would be much appreciated.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Instead of just suggesting the this is unfeasible, I would suggest considering a scheme that samples the important subset of all possible combinations instead of applying a brute force approach. As one of your replies suggested, you are doing minimization. There are numerical techniques to do this such as simulated annealing, monte carlo sampling as well as traditional minimization algorithms. You might want to look into whether one is appropriate in your case.\n    "}

The entire thing is written using pandas to manipulate CSVs and do some transformations, as well as side inputs from external sources. (It makes use of bigquery and storage APIs). The thing is, it runs on a 32vCPUs\/120GB RAM Compute Engine instance (VM) and it does simple parallel processing with python's multiprocessing library. We are currently thinking about switching to Dataflow, and what I'd like to know is: if I were to implement the same pipeline using Beam's DirectRunner, how should I expect the performance to compare to that of the current implementation? Would it be faster or slower and why? Will the DirectRunner use well all the machine resources or is it limited somehow?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You question is broad. However, I will try to provide you some inputs. It's hard to compare a DirectRunner and a DataflowRunner. \n\nDirectRunner launches your pipeline on your current VM and use the capability of this only VM. It's your VM, you have to set it up, patch it, take care to free disk\/partition\/logs file, (...)   \nDataflowRunner launches the pipeline to a managed platform. Dataflow, according with its metrics and \"prediction\" (no ML here!) chooses to scale up or down the number of VM to execute as quickly as possible your pipeline. You can set small VM (1 vCPU for example) and Dataflow will spawn a lot of them, or bigger VM and, maybe that dataflow will spawn only 1 because it's enough for the pipeline.\n\nPro tips: the VM bandwidth is limited to 2Gbs per vCPU up to 8 vCPU. Take care of the network bottleneck and choose wisely the VM size (I recommend VM with 4 or 8 vCPU usually) \nOn one side, you have only one VM to manage, on the other side, you only have to set parameters and let Dataflow managing and scaling your pipeline.\nI don't know your growth perspective, but vertical scalability (adding more vCPU\/memory on your single VM) can reach a limit a day. With Dataflow, it's elastic and you don't worry about this; in addition of server management and patching.\nFinally, answer to your question \"faster or slower\", too hard to answer... Dataflow, if it run on several VM, will add network latency, dataflow internal management overhead, but can scale to use more vCPU in parallel at some point of time compare to your current VM. Is your pipeline can leverage of this parallelism or not? Is it solve some of your current bottleneck? Too hard to answer on my side.\n    "}

The basic format is:-\nword: <docnum ,positions>, <docnum ,positions>, <docnum ,positions> .....\nWhenever there is a search query inside quote like \"Harry Potter Movies\" it means there should be exact match of positions of word and in searches like within k word queries like hello \/4 world it generally means that find the word world in the range of 4 word distance either in left or right from the word hello. My question is that we can employ solution like linearly checking the postings and calculating distances of words like in query, but if collection is really large we can't really search all the postings. So is there any other data structure or kind of optimisation lucene or solr uses?\nOne first solution can be only searching some k postings for each word. Other solution can be only searching top docs(usually called champion list sorted by tf-idf or similar during indexing), but more better docs can be ignored.

How?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The phrase query you are asking about here is actually really efficient to compute the positions of, because you're asking for the documents where 'Harry' AND 'Potter' AND 'Movies' occur.\nLucene is pretty smart, but the core of its algorithm for this is that it only needs to visit the positions lists of documents where all three of these terms even occur.\nLucene's postings are also sharded into multiple files:\nInside the counts-files are: (Document, TF, PositionsAddr)+\nInside the positions-files are: (PositionsArray)\nSo it can sweep across the (doc, tf, pos_addr) for each of these three terms, and only consult the PositionsArray when all three words occur in the specific document. Phrase queries have the opportunity to be really quick, because you only visit at most all the documents from the least-frequent term.\nIf you want to see a phrase query run slowly (and do lots of disk seeks!), try: \"to be or not to be\" ... here the AND part doesn't help much because all the terms are very common.\n    "}

After carrying out the training process, I was trying to run the program to detect objects in webcam. As I was running it, the following message was printed in the terminal:\n\nAllocator (GPU_0_bfc) ran out of memory trying to allocate 2.05GiB\n  with freed_by_count=0. The caller indicates that this is not a\n  failure, but may mean that there could be performance gains if more\n  memory were available\n\nDue to the performace issue it seems I am getting a lot of false positives.\nHow can we calculate beforehand the memory required to run this program, or any program?\nI am not asking how much memory it is using, which we can find out. I am using Python.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In Object Detection, most of the Layers used will be CNNs and the Calculation of Memory Consumption for CNN is explained below. You can follow the same approach for other layers of the Model.\n\nFor example,\n  consider a convolutional layer with 5 × 5 filters, outputting 200\n  feature maps of size 150 × 100, with stride 1 and SAME padding. If the\n  input is a 150 × 100 RGB image (three channels), then the number of\n  parameters is (5 × 5 × 3 + 1) × 200\n  = 15,200 (the +1 corresponds to the bias terms), which is fairly small compared to a fully connected layer.7 However, each of the 200 feature\n  maps contains 150 × 100 neurons, and each of these neurons needs to\n  compute a weighted sum of its 5 × 5 × 3 = 75 inputs: that’s a total of\n  225 million float multiplications. Not as bad as a fully con‐nected\n  layer, but still quite computationally intensive. Moreover, if the\n  feature maps are represented using 32-bit floats, then the\n  convolutional layer’s output will occupy 200 × 150 × 100 × 32 = 96\n  million bits (about 11.4 MB) of RAM.8  And that’s just for one\n  instance! If a training batch contains 100 instances, then this layer\n  will use up over 1 GB of RAM!\n\nMore understanding about Memory Consumption can be found from the below Question and the respective Answer:\nQuestion: \n\nConsider a CNN composed of three convolutional layers, each with 3 × 3\n  kernels, a stride of 2, and SAME padding. The lowest layer outputs 100\n  feature maps, the middle one outputs 200, and the top one outputs 400.\n  The input images are RGB images of 200 × 300 pixels. What is the total\n  number of parameters in the CNN? If we are using 32-bit floats, at\n  least how much RAM will this network require when making a prediction\n  for a single instance? What about when training on a mini-batch of 50\n  images?\n\nAnswer is mentioned below:\n\nLet’s compute how many parameters the CNN has. Since its first\n  convolutional layer has 3 × 3 kernels, and the input has three\n  channels (red, green, and blue), then each feature map has 3 × 3 × 3\n  weights, plus a bias term. That’s 28 parame‐ ters per feature map.\n  Since this first convolutional layer has 100 feature maps, it has a\n  total of 2,800 parameters. The second convolutional layer has 3 × 3\n  kernels, and its input is the set of 100 feature maps of the previous\n  layer, so each feature map has 3 × 3 × 100 = 900 weights, plus a bias\n  term. Since it has 200 feature maps, this layer has 901 × 200 =\n  180,200 parameters. Finally, the third and last convolutional layer\n  also has 3 × 3 kernels, and its input is the set of 200 feature maps\n  of the previous layers, so each feature map has 3 × 3 × 200 = 1,800\n  weights, plus a bias term. Since it has 400 feature maps, this layer\n  has a total of 1,801 × 400\n  = 720,400 parameters. All in all, the CNN has 2,800 + 180,200 + 720,400 = 903,400 parameters. Now let’s compute how much RAM this\n  neural network will require (at least) when making a prediction for a\n  single instance. First let’s compute the feature map size for each\n  layer. Since we are using a stride of 2 and SAME padding, the\n  horizontal and vertical size of the feature maps are divided by 2 at\n  each layer (rounding up if necessary), so as the input channels are\n  200 × 300 pixels, the first layer’s feature maps are 100 × 150, the\n  second layer’s feature maps are 50 × 75, and the third layer’s feature\n  maps are 25 × 38. Since 32 bits is 4 bytes and the first convolutional\n  layer has 100 feature maps, this first layer takes up 4 x 100 × 150 ×\n  100 = 6 million bytes (about 5.7 MB, considering that 1 MB = 1,024 KB\n  and 1 KB\n  = 1,024 bytes). The second layer takes up 4 × 50 × 75 × 200 = 3 million bytes (about 2.9 MB). Finally, the third layer takes up 4 × 25\n  × 38 × 400 = 1,520,000 bytes (about 1.4 MB). However, once a layer has\n  been computed, the memory occupied by the previous layer can be\n  released, so if everything is well optimized, only 6 + 9 = 15 million\n  bytes (about 14.3 MB) of RAM will be required (when the second layer\n  has just been computed, but the memory occupied by the first layer is\n  not released yet). But wait, you also need to add the memory occupied\n  by the CNN’s parameters. We computed earlier that it has 903,400\n  parameters, each using up 4 bytes, so this adds 3,613,600 bytes (about\n  3.4 MB). The total RAM required is (at least) 18,613,600 bytes (about 17.8 MB).\n\nFor more information, refer \"Memory Requirements\" Section of \"Chapter 13, Convolutional Neural Networks\" of the Book, \"Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow\" (pdfs are availble online).\n    "}

However, proper procedure requires that you keep your training and test data entirely separate.  The overall concept is that the test data are not directly represented in the training; this helps reduce over-fitting.  The test data (and later validation data) are samples that the trained model has never encountered during training.\nTherefore, the test data should not be included in your pre-processing -- the document-term matrix.  This breaks the separation, in that the model has, in one respect, \"seen\" the test data during training.\nQuantitatively, you need to do the split first, because that matrix is to be used for training the model against only the training set.  When you included the test data in the matrix, you obtained a matrix that is slightly inaccurate in representing the training data: it no longer properly represents the data you're actually training against.  This is why your model isn't quite as good as the one that followed proper separation procedures.\nIt's a subtle difference, most of all because the training and test sets are supposed to be random samples of the same population of possible inputs.  Random differences provide the small surprise you encountered.\n    "}

The reason for its success is that matrix stuff and plotting work out of the box, and you can do a few very specific things in it with virtually no actual programming knowledge.  The language is, as you point out, extremely frustrating to use for more general-purpose tasks, such as even the simplest string processing.  Its syntax is quirky, and it wasn't created with the abstractions necessary for projects of more than 100 lines or so in mind.\nI think the reason why people try to use Matlab as a serious programming language is that most engineers (there are exceptions; my degree is in biomedical engineering and I like programming) are horrible programmers and hate to program.  They're taught Matlab in college mostly for the matrix math, and they learn some rudimentary programming as part of learning Matlab, and just assume that Matlab is good enough.  I can't think of anyone I know who knows any language besides Matlab, but still uses Matlab for anything other than a few pure number crunching applications.\n    "}

If the first field was instead stored at the most significant positions, I'd first have to reverse my list of calculated field widths before I could use it.\nHere's a more concrete example:\nCSV file: abc,12345\nScanned field widths: either [3, 5] or [5, 3] depending on how the CSV file is laid out in memory.\nNow, if I call read(), the first field I'll process is abc. If abc happened to be the first field I scanned through when calculating the field widths, I'm good. I'll know that I've scanned the entire first field after reading 3 characters. However, if I first scanned 12345 when calculating the field widths, I've got a problem.\nHow can I determine how a file is laid out in memory? Is the first field of a file stored in the least significant bit positions, or the most significant bit positions?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Endiannes is a problem of binary files.

I'm trying to code a reasonably optimized solution so I don't have to let my PC sit for days.\nGoing through the C word2vec source code, I notice that there, each thread reads words from a file, and takes the time to look up the index of every word.

Google's word2vec.c code, like many other implementations, seeks to work well with input corpuses that are far larger than addressable memory.

One step involves calculating the similarity (for some unimportant definition of \"similar\") of every document to every other document in a given corpus, and storing the similarities for later use.  The similarities are bucketed, and I don't care what the specific similarity is for purposes of my analysis, just what bucket it's in.  For example, if documents 15378 and 3278 are 52% similar, the ordered pair (3278, 15378) gets stored in the [0.5,0.6) bucket.  Documents sometimes get either added or removed from the corpus after initial analysis, so corresponding pairs get added to or removed from the buckets as needed.\nI'm looking at strategies for storing these lists of ID pairs.  We found a SQL database (where most of our other data for this project lives) to be too slow and too large disk-space-wise for our purposes, so at the moment we store each bucket as a compressed list of integers on disk (originally zlib-compressed, but now using lz4 instead for speed).  Things I like about this:\n\nReading and writing are both quite fast\nAfter-the-fact additions to the corpus are fairly straightforward to add (a bit less so for lz4 than for zlib because lz4 doesn't have a framing mechanism built in, but doable)\nAt both write and read time, data can be streamed so it doesn't need to be held in memory all at once, which would be prohibitive given the size of our corpora\n\nThings that kind of suck:\n\nDeletes are a huge pain, and basically involve streaming through all the buckets and writing out new ones that omit any pairs that contain the ID of a document that's been deleted\nI suspect I could still do better both in terms of speed and compactness with a more special-purpose data structure and\/or compression strategy\n\nSo: what kinds of data structures should I be looking at?  I suspect that the right answer is some kind of exotic succinct data structure, but this isn't a space I know very well.  Also, if it matters: all of the document IDs are unsigned 32-bit ints, and the current code that handles this data is written in C, as Python extensions, so that's probably the general technology family we'll stick with if possible.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>How about using one hash table or B-tree per bucket?\nOn-disk hashtables are standard. Maybe the BerkeleyDB libraries (availabe in stock python) will work for you; but be advised that they since they come with transactions they can be slow, and may require some tuning. There are a number of choices: gdbm, tdb that you should all give a try. Just make sure you check out the API and initialize them with appropriate size. Some will not resize automatically, and if you feed them too much data their performance just drops a lot.\nAnyway, you may want to use something even more low-level, without transactions, if you have a lot of changes.\nA pair of ints is a long - and most databases should accept a long as a key; in fact many will accept arbitrary byte sequences as keys.\n    "}

It's not a problem to take a np.log(x) of an array.

If you want to see a big speed increase, you'll need to implement your algorithm differently.\nIs it really necessary to take the log of all these elements? You mention that each dimension can have 100 samples, do you plan on averaging these samples? If so you can reduce the number of logarithms you need to compute by using the fact that log(a) + log(b) = log(ab), and so the average [log(a0) + log(a1) + ... + log(aN)]\/(a0 + a1 + ... + aN) is the same as log(a0*a1*...*aN)\/(a0 + a1 + ... + aN).\n    "}

I have got a time signal representing sound pressure(Pa). I have arrays of the central frequencies and of the lower and upper cutoffs.The final aim is to get a bar chart representing sound level versus the 1\/3rd octave bands.\nFrom a theory that I followed suggested to first do FFT of the signal. Then reconstruct the signal in the 1\/3rd octave bands. In each of the construction, compute the RMS values of the pressure. That's it. Convert these RMS values into sound level(dB) and plot against the central frequencies.\nThe issue I am facing is how to reconstruct the signal using IFFT function given that the new signal has less number of amplitude points. So, the reconstruction is essentially not possible because of dimension inconsistency between time and amplitude. I am stuck at this point.\nI have a very little experience in DSP. So, any help even if the approach is different from what I tried explaining above will be much appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To reconstruct the time-domain signal for a particular 1\/3 octave band, you set the amplitude to zero for all the frequencies outside of your band before you do the IFFT.  The IFFTs for each of those bands will be the same size as our original FFT, so you will end up with the same time resolution on output from each band.\nDoing a full-size IFFT for each band is obviously pretty expensive.  There are ways to optimize this, but really there is probably no reason for you to be reconstructing the time-domain signal in the first place.\nThe IFFT operation1 will not change the RMS value of signal, so just calculate this using the frequency-domain components and forget about the IFFT altogether.  Because of the way the RMS computation works, you don't even need to remember that the frequency-domain amplitudes are complex numbers -- you get a proportional answer if you treat the real and imaginary components the same way.  Just don't forget to include all the extra zeros in the RMS divisor, since there are a different number of them for each band.\n1 - This is true for a mathematically standard IFFT.  Some implementations will divide the outputs by the signal length.  This will be the same for all bands, so it won't affect their relative values and it's easy to correct for.\n    "}

For example, a simple loop that goes over every item in a one dimensional array of size n has a O(n) run time - which is to say that it will always run at the proportional time per size of the array no matter what.\nSay you have a 2 dimensional array of X,Y coords and you are going to loop across every potential combination of x\/y locations, where x is size n and y is size m, your Big O would be O(mn)\nand so on. Big O is used to compare the relative speed of different algorithms in abstraction, so that you can try to determine which one is better to use.\nIf you grab O(n) over the different potential sizes of n, you end up with a straight 45 degree line on your graph.\nAs you get into more complex algorithms you can end up with O(n^2) or O(log n) or even more complex. -- generally though most algorithms fall into either O(n), O(n^(some exponent)), O(log n) or O(sqrt(n)) - there are obviously others but generally most fall into this with some form of co-efficient in front or after that modifies where they are on the graph. If you graph each one of those curves you'll see which ones are better for extremely large data sets very quickly\nIt would entirely depend on how well your algorithm is coded, but it might look something like this: (don't trust me on this math, i tried to start doing it and then just googled it.)\nFitting a decision tree of depth ‘m’:\n\nNaïve analysis: 2m-1 trees -> O(2m-1 n d log(n)).\neach object appearing only once at a given depth: O(m n d log n)\n\nand a Log n graph ... well pretty much doesn't change at all even with sufficiently large numbers of n, does it?\nso it doesn't matter how big your data set is, these algorithms are very efficient in what they do, but also do not scale because of the nature of a log curve on a graph (the worst increase in performance for +1 n is at the very beginning, then it levels off with only extremely minor increases to time with more and more n)\n    "}

I would say that while OpenCV is more focus on computer vision (classification, feature detection and extraction,...). However lately scikit-image is improving rapidly. \nI faced that some algorithms perform faster under OpenCV, however in most cases I find much more easier working with scikit-image, OpenCV documentations is quite cryptic.\nAs long as OpenCV 2.x bindings works with numpy as well as scikit-image I would take into account using both libraries, trying to take the better of each of them.

Maybe you should look into a smaller network that is faster to predict, or predict on the CPU if your experiments are done in a GPU, to minimize overhead due to transfer.\nDon't forget that model.predict does a full forward pass of the network, so its speed completely depends on the network architecture.\n    "}

To develop the code I used a small sample image, and after some work the code was working brilliantly.  However, when I normalize the histogram first, generating bin values <<1, or when I histogram huge images, generating bin values in the hundreds of thousands, fmin_slsqp() starts failing sporadically.  It quits after only ~5 iterations, usually just returning a slightly modified version of the initial guess I gave it, and returns exit mode 8, which means \"Positive directional derivative for linesearch.\"  If I check the size of the bin counts at the beginning and scale them into the neighborhood of ~100-1000, fmin_slsqp() works as usual. I just un-scale things before returning the results. I guess I could leave it like that, but it feels like a hack.\nI have looked around and found folks talking about the epsilon value, which is basically the dx used for approximating derivatives, but tweaking that has not helped.

Also this has combinatorial complexity which is obviously undesirable.\nThanks.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You want to generate a random n*m matrix of integers 1..k with every integer used, and no integer used twice in any row.  And you want to do it efficiently.\nIf you just want to generate a reasonable answer, reasonably quickly, you can generate the rows by taking a random selection of elements, and putting them into a random order.  numpy.random.random_sample and numpy.random.shuffle can do that.  You will avoid the duplicate element issue.  If you fail to use all of your elements, then what you can do is randomly \"evolve\" this towards a correct solution,  At every step identify all elements that are repeated more than once in the matrix, randomly select one, and convert it to an as yet unused integer from 1..k.  This will not cause duplications within rows, and will in at most k steps give you a matrix of the desired form.\nOdds are that this is a good enough answer for what you want, and is what you should do.  But it is imperfect - matrices of this form do not all happen with exactly equal probability.  (In particular ones with lots of elements only appearing once show up slightly more than they should.)  If you need a perfectly even distribution, then you're going to have to do a lot more work.\nTo get there you need a bit of theory.  If you have that theory, then you can understand the answer as, \"Do a dynamic programming solution forwards to find a count of all possible solutions, then run that backwards making random decisions to identify a random solution.\"  Odds are that you don't have that theory.\nI'm not going to give a detailed explanation of that theory.  I'll just outline what you do.\nYou start with the trivial statement, \"There are n!\/(n-m)! ways in which I could have a matrix with 1 row satisfying my condition using m of the k integers, and none which use more.\"\nFor i from 1..n, for j from m to k, you figure out the count of ways in which you could build i rows using j of the k integers.  You ALSO keep track of how many of those ways came from which previous values for j for the previous row.  (You'll need that later.)  This step can be done in a double loop.\nNote that the value in the table you just generated for j=k and i=n is the number of matrices that satisfy all of your conditions.  We'll build a random one from the bottom up.\nFirst you generate a random row for the last row of your matrix - all are equally likely.\nFor each row until you get to the top, you use the table you built to randomly decide how many of the elements that you used in the last row you generated will never be used again.  Randomly decide which those elements will be.  Generate a random row from the integers that you are still using.\nWhen you get to the top you'll have chosen a random matrix meeting your description, with no biases in how it was generated.\n    "}

During this preprocessing step, I want to treat continuous and categorical data differently. In particular, I want to be able to apply, e.g., a OneHotEncoder to only the categorical data.\nNow, let's assume that we're provided a pandas.DataFrame and have no other information about the data in the DataFrame. What is a good heuristic to use to determine whether a column in the pandas.DataFrame is categorical?\nMy initial thoughts are:\n1) If there are strings in the column (e.g., the column data type is object), then the column very likely contains categorical data\n2) If some percentage of the values in the column is unique (e.g., >=20%), then the column very likely contains continuous data\nI've found 1) to work fine, but 2) hasn't panned out very well. I need better heuristics. How would you solve this problem?\nEdit: Someone requested that I explain why 2) didn't work well. There were some tests cases where we still had continuous values in a column but there weren't many unique values in the column. The heuristic in 2) obviously failed in that case. There were also issues where we had a categorical column that had many, many unique values, e.g., passenger names in the Titanic data set. Same column type misclassification problem there.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>IMO the opposite strategy, identifying categoricals is better because it depends on what the data is about. Technically address data can be thought of as unordered categorical data, but usually I wouldn't use it that way.\nFor survey data, an idea would be to look for Likert scales, e.g. 5-8 values, either strings (which might probably need hardcoded (and translated) levels to look for \"good\", \"bad\", \".agree.\", \"very .*\",...) or int values in the 0-8 range + NA.\nCountries and such things might also be identifiable...\nAge groups (\".-.\") might also work.\n    "}

But as far as I know that MSE sometimes not going well compared to cross entropy for one-hot like what I want.\nAnd specific: GT like this: 0 0 0 0 1 (let say we have only 5 classes in total, each only has 1 class so only one number 1 in them, of course this is class 5th in this example)\nand output model at classification part: 0.1 0.1 0.9 0.2 0.1\nI found some suggestion use nn.BCE \/ nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss but I think I should ask here for more correct since I’m not good at math and maybe I’m wrong somewhere so just ask to learn more and for sure what should I use correctly?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>MSE loss is usually used for regression problem.\n\nFor binary classification, you can either use BCE or BCEWithLogitsLoss.

A pre-trained VGG or CNN network, with its final classification layer removed; can be used for feature extraction.\nA dictionary with KEY as the IMAGE_FILENAME and VALUE as the FEATURE_VECTOR can be created for all the images in the folder. This will make the co-relation between the filename and it’s feature vector easier.\nThen create a single feature vector say X, which comprises of individual feature vectors of each image in the folder\/group which needs to be clustered. \nIn my use case, X had the dimension as : NUMBER OF IMAGE IN THE FOLDER, 128 (i.e SIZE OF EACH FEATURE VECTOR). For instance, Shape of X : 50,128\nThis feature vector can then be used to fit an Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster. One needs to fine tune the distance threshold parameter empirically.\nFinally, we can write a code to identify which IMAGE_FILENAME belongs to which cluster.\nIn my case, there were about 50 images per folder so this was a manageable solution.

The problem is, the memory usage can grow rapidly. As swap space is called in, the system slows down significantly. The general strategy I have seen:\n\nlazy initialization: this doesn't seem to help in the sense that many operations require in memory data anyway. \nshelving: this Python standard library seems support writing data object into a datafile (backed by some db) . My understanding is that it dumps data to a file, but if you need it, you still have to load all of them into memory, so it doesn't exactly help. Please correct me if this is a misunderstanding.\nThe third option is to leverage a database, and offload as much data processing to it\n\nAs an example: a scientific experiment runs several days and have generated a huge (tera bytes of data) sequence of:\n\nco-ordinate(x,y) observed event E at time t.\n\nAnd we need to compute a histogram over t for each (x,y) and output a 3-dimensional array.\nAny other suggestions? I guess my ideal case would be the in-memory data structure can be phased to disk based on a soft memory limit and this process should be as transparent as possible. Can any of these caching frameworks help? \nEdit:\nI appreciate all the suggested points and directions. Among those, I found user488551's comments to be most relevant. As much as I like Map\/Reduce, to many scientific apps, the setup and effort for parallelization of code is even a bigger problem to tackle than my original question, IMHO. It is difficult to pick an answer as my question itself is so open ... but Bill's answer is more close to what we can do in real world, hence the choice. Thank you all.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Well, if you need the whole dataset in RAM, there's not much to do but get more RAM. Sounds like you aren't sure if you really need to, but keeping all the data resident requires the smallest amount of thinking :) \nIf your data comes in a stream over a long period of time, and all you are doing is creating a histogram, you don't need to keep it all resident.  Just create your histogram as you go along, write the raw data out to a file if you want to have it available later, and let Python garbage collect the data as soon as you have bumped your histogram counters.  All you have to keep resident is the histogram itself, which should be relatively small.\n    "}

The vendor adds\/removes\/modifies columns from the file as they please. So the schema is not known ahead of time. The requirement is to create a table on-the-fly in Snowflake and load the data into said table. Matillion is our ELT tool.\nThis is what I have done so far.\n\nSetup a Lambda to detect the arrival of the file, convert it to JSON, upload to another S3 dir and adds filename to SQS.\nMatillion detects SQS message and loads the file with the JSON Data into Variant column in a SF table.\nSF Stored proc takes the variant column and generates a table based on the number of fields in the JSON data. The VARIANT column in SF only works in this way if its JSON data. CSV is sadly not supported.\n\nThis works with 10,000 rows. The problem arises when I run this with a full file which is over 1GB, which is over 10M rows. It crashes the lambda job with an out of disk space error at runtime.\nThese are the alternatives I have thought of so far:\n\nAttach an EFS volume to the lambda and use it to store the JSON file prior to the upload to S3. JSON data files are so much larger than their CSV counterparts, I expect the json file to be around 10-20GB since the file has over 10M rows.\nMatillion has an Excel Query component where it can take the headers and create a table on the fly and load the file. I was thinking I can convert the header row from the CSV into a XLX file within the Lambda, pass it to over to Matillion, have it create the structures and then load the csv file once the structure is created.\n\nWhat are my other options here? Considerations include a nice repeatable design pattern to be used for future large CSVs or similar requirements, costs of the EFS, am I making the best use of the tools that I are avaialable to me?

Simple question about sklearn's random forest: \nFor a true\/false classification problem, is there a way in sklearn's random forest to specify the sample size used to train each tree, along with the ratio of true to false observations?\nMore details are below:\n\nIn the R implementation of random forest, called randomForest, there's an option sampsize(). This allows you to balance the sample used to train each tree based on the outcome. \nFor example, if you're trying to predict whether an outcome is true or false and 90% of the outcomes in the training set are false, you can set sampsize(500, 500). This means that each tree will be trained on a random sample (with replacement) from the training set with 500 true and 500 false observations. In these situations, I've found models perform much better predicting true outcomes when using a 50% cut-off, yielding much higher kappas. \nIt doesn't seem like there is an option for this in the sklearn implementation. \n\nIs there any way to mimic this functionality in sklearn? \nWould simply optimizing the cut-off based on the Kappa statistic achieve a similar result or is something lost in this approach?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>After reading over the documentation, I think that the answer is definitely no.

I've looked around this site and tried to cobble together code to do what I need it to, but I keep running into problems. Firstly, I need to convert a file of 2 columns and 512 rows of strings to floats then put them in a 512x2 array. I check the first column (all rows) for negative values. If negative, add 512. Then I need to reorder the rows in numerical order and write\/save the new array. \nOn to my first problem, converting to floats and putting the floats into an array. I have this code, which I made from others' questions:\nwith open(\"binfixtest.composite\") as f:\n  f_values = map(lambda l: l.strip().split('   '), f)\n  print f_values\n  newarray = [map(float, v) for v in f_values]\nOriginal format of file: \n-91.  0.444253325\n-90.  0.883581936\n-89. -0.0912338793\nNew format of f_values:\n['-91.  0.444253325'], ['-90.  0.883581936'], ['-89. -0.0912338793']\nI'm getting the error:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \".\/binfix.py\", line 10, in <module>\n    newarray = [map(float, v) for v in f_values]\n ValueError: invalid literal for float(): -91.  0.444253325 \nwhich I can't seem to fix.

So you can deal with more data in a NumPy array (in-memory) than you can with Python lists.\nNumPy arrays have a vast library of functions and methods unavailable\nto Python lists or Python arrays.\n\nYes, you can not simply convert lists to NumPy arrays and expect your code to continue to work. The methods are different, the bool semantics are different. For the best performance, even the algorithm may need to change.\nHowever, if you are looking for a Python replacement for Matlab, you will definitely find uses for NumPy.

(So the linearity assumption goes out the window)\nBreaking some of the linear regression assumptions may not inherently decrease the predictive ability of your model,  but WILL bias the coefficients. Often times, when building a regression model you are trying to determine the effect of an X variable on the Y. In this case you mainly only care about this weight and don't care as much about how well your model predicts. If you are aiming only for predictive ability you can break some assumptions.\n\nThese are the main 2 thoughts that come to mind. I would be interested to hear other people's take as well.\n    "}

Simply said instead of learning patterns in your data, the model will be able to learn every case it is presented in the training set by heart.\nTo avoid this, you will have to choose a model that is less complex, in your case reduce the depth of your trees. Split your data in separate train, validation and test sets, then train different models of different complexities. When you evaluate these models, you will notice that its predictive capabilities on the training set will increase with complexity. Initially its capabilities on the validation set will follow until a point is reached where no more increase on the validation set can be achieved. On the contrary, it will likely decrease beyond this point, because you are starting to overfit.\nUse this data to find a suitable model, then finally evaluate the model you decided to use by using the test set you have kept aside until now.\n    "}

Maybe you could break the process that you've mentioned into smaller chunks (i.e., storage of data, extraction of data), and work on each chunk\/stage individually, which hopefully will reduce the overall size of your data!\nOtherwise, you could perhaps take advantage of database management systems (SQL or NoSQL depending on which fits best) which might be better, though querying that amount of data might constitute yet another issue.\nI'm by no means an expert in this but I'm just explaining more of how I've dealt with excessively large datasets (similar to what you're currently experiencing) in the past, and I'm pretty sure someone here will probably give you a more definitive answer as compared to my 'a little of everything' answer.

While the most accurate measurement of the overlap is the intersection volume, it's too computationally expensive as I am dealing with complex objects with 1000+ faces and are not convex.\nI am wondering if there are other measurements of intersection between 3d objects that are much faster to compute? 2 requirements for the measurement are: 1. When the measurement is 0, there should be no overlap; 2. The measurement should be a scalar(not a boolean value) indicating the degree of overlapping, but this value doesn't need to be very accurate.\nPossible measurements I am considering include some sort of 2D surface area of intersection, or 1D penetration depth. Alternatively I can estimate volume with a sample based method that sample points inside one object and test the percentage of points that exist in another object. But I don't know how computational expensive it is to sample points inside a complex 3d shape as well as to test if a point is enclosed by such a shape.\nI will really appreciate any advices, codes, or equations on this matter. Also if you can suggest any libraries (preferably python library) that accept .obj, .ply...etc files and perform 3D geometry computation that will be great! I will also post here if I find out a good method.\nUpdate:\nI found a good python library called Trimesh that performs all the computations mentioned by me and others in this post. It computes the exact intersection volume with the Blender backend; it can voxelize meshes and compute the volume of the co-occupied voxels; it can also perform surface and volumetric points sampling within one mesh and test points containment within another mesh. I found surface point sampling and containment testing(sort of surface intersection) and the grid approach to be the fastest.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>By straight voxelization:\nIf the faces are of similar size (if needed triangulate the large ones), you can use a gridding approach: define a regular 3D grid with a spacing size larger than the longest edge and store one bit per voxel.\nThen for every vertex of the mesh, set the bit of the cell it is included in (this just takes a truncation of the coordinates). By doing this, you will obtain the boundary of the object as a connected surface. You will obtain an estimate of the volume by means of a 3D flood filling algorithm, either from an inside or an outside pixel. (Outside will be easier but be sure to leave a one voxel margin around the object.)\nEstimating the volumes of both objects as well as intersection or union is straightforward with this machinery. The cost will depend on the number of faces and the number of voxels.\n    "}

One simple usecase to justify this statement is backtracking. With Pandas, you can quickly trace back and regain the dataset to its original form or an earlier analysed form. With Excel, you could get lost after a maze of analysis, and might be in a lose of backtrack to an earlier form outside of cntrl + z\nTeaching Tool: In my opinion, this is the most underutilized feature.

You can store this any way you like along with the distributed application.

If your weights and biases are just a bunch of local variables, you will want put them into a structure like a dict first.\n    "}

While the game is playing, we make a screen capture of the gameplay. One of the data we capture is when they push a button to request information during the game.\nWe are trying to understand if there are conditions related to lighting, decision points, etc. that are causing the button to be pushed. Ultimately the goal is to build a predictive model that will present the data before the subject asks for it.\nMy question is what is the best approach to analyze the video vs. the button push for information? We have timestamped csv files with the button push data and a video of the gameplay. Originally I thought of using Matlab to do the analysis, but I couldn't find a good example of how to approach the problem. I have a couple folks skilled at python on the team that I could ask for help as well, but I had wanted to see if I could understand what needed to be done before tasking them to do it.\nAny help is appreciated!\nThanks\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think it is best if you consult a professional data scientist. However, I can think of one way to approach your problem.\nBecause a video is what data scientists call unstructured data, you'll have a hard time analyzing it raw.\nWhat I would do is to define some key points during the gameplay (ie. beginning of a new level or confronting a new puzzle), create a time interval around that key point, and chart the button pushed based on these intervals.\nConsider a set of gameplay videos with 2 key points. For example, the key point in one of the videos is set in times 04:13 and 32:00. So the video's timeline should look something like this.\n\n(Begining) 00:00 --------> 04:13 --------> 32:00 --------> 45:00 (End)\n\nNow for each key point, define a time interval of say, 2 minutes and record if the button is pushed in the obtained time intervals. So for key point number one, you will have 02:13 until 06:13.

Use a simple search algorithm to find that if the KeyPoint is in the first class High Number of Buttons Pushed or in the second class, Low Number of Buttons Pushed.

However it is easy to introduce some sort of data leakage when you use CV, data leakage makes the results less trustful.\nComparison between training and test should tell you if you are overfitting your model or if you should make model more fitted.

Worse, for 3000 points, an interpolating spline will give you roughly that many cubic segments! You did say interpolation before. OF course, an interpolating polynomial of that high an order will be complete crapola anyway, so don't think you can just go back there.\nIf all that you need is a tool that can provide an exact interpolation at any point, and you really don't need to have an explicit formula, then an interpolating spline is a good choice.\nOr do you really want an approximant? A function that will APPROXIMATELY fit your data, smoothing out any noise? The fact is, a lot of the time when people who have no idea what they are doing say \"interpolation\" they really do mean approximation, smoothing. This is possible of course, but there are entire books written on the subject of curve fitting, the modeling of empirical data. You first goal is then to choose an intelligent model, that will represent this data. Best of course is if you have some intelligent choice of model from physical understanding of the relationship under study, then you can estimate the parameters of that model using a nonlinear regression scheme, of which there are many to be found.\nIf you have no model, and are unwilling to choose one that roughly has the proper shape, then you are left with generic models in the form of splines, which can be fit in a regression sense, or with high order polynomial models, for which I have little respect.\nMy point in all of this is YOU need to make some choices and do some research on a choice of model.\n    "}

Normally, I would use numpy.random.choice() for this sort of task, but this function only works for 1-dimensional probability densities. Is there an equivalent function for multivariate PDFs?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There a few different paths one can follow here.\n(1) If P(x,y,z) factors as P(x,y,z) = P(x) P(y) P(z) (i.e., x, y, and z are independent) then you can sample each one separately.\n(2) If P(x,y,z) has a more general factorization, you can reduce the number of variables that need to be sampled to whatever's conditional on the others. E.g. if P(x,y,z) = P(z|x, y) P(y | x) P(x), then you can sample x, y given x, and z given y and x in turn.\n(3) For some particular distributions, there are known ways to sample. E.g. for multivariate Gaussian, if x is a sample from a mean 0 and identity covariance Gaussian (i.e. just sample each x_i as N(0, 1)), then y = L x + m has mean m and covariance S = L L' where L is the lower-triangular Cholesky decomposition of S, which must be positive definite.\n(4) For many multivariate distributions, none of the above apply, and a more complicated scheme such as Markov chain Monte Carlo is applied. \nMaybe if you say more about the problem, more specific advice can be given.\n    "}

So I created my virtual environment activated it and installed the neat-python using pip in the VE. When I then tried to run one of the examples from their GitHub page it threw an error like this: \n\nImportError: No module named visualize\n\nSo I checked my source files, and actually the neat-python doesn't include the visualize.py script, however it is in their GitHub repository. I then tried to add it myself by downloading just the visualize.oy script dragging it inside my VE and adding it to all the textfiles the NEAT brought with it, like the installed-filex.txt etc. However it still threw the same error. \nI'm still fairly new to VE and GitHub so please don't be too hard on me :] thanks in advance.\n-Jorge\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think you could simply copying the visualize.py into the same directory as the script you are running.\nIf you wanted it in your lib\/site-packages directory so you could import it with the neat module:\ncopy visualize.py into lib\/site-packages\/neat\/ and modify __init__.py to add the line import neat.visualize as visualize. Delete the __pycache__ directory. Make sure you have modules installed: Numpy, GraphViz, and Matplotlib. When you've done the above, you should be able to import neat and access neat.visualize. \nI don't recommend doing this though for several reasons:\n\nSay you wanted to update your neat module. Your visualize.py file is technically not part of the module. So it wouldn't be updated along with your neat module.\nthe visualize.py file seems to be written in the context of the examples as opposed to being for general use with the module, so contextually, it doesn't belong there.\nAt some point in the future, you might also forget that this wasn't a part of the module, but your code acts as if it was part of the API. So your code will break in some other neat installation.\n    "}

However, if our model is very complex (especially if we have a limited amount of data at our disposal), we run the risk of overfitting. Deep learning takes the approach of solving very complex problems with complex models and taking additional countermeasures to prevent overfitting.\nThree of the most common ways to do that are\n\nRegularization\nDropout\nData augmentation\n\nIf your model is not complex enough:\n\nMake it bigger (easy)\nMake it smarter (hard)\n    "}

What difference then, what scale is chosen?\n    "}

The normal procedure for this kind of situation is to find a way to either use the probabilities, say by using them to calculate an expected value, or by taking the maximum probability that is output and choose that one as the network's prediction. If you aren't using the output for calculating your loss function though, you can go ahead and just apply it to the result and it doesn't matter if it's differentiable. Now, if you want an informative loss function for the purpose of training the network, maybe you should consider whether keeping the output in the format of probabilities might actually be to your advantage (it will likely make your training process smoother)- that way you can just convert the probabilities to actual estimates outside of the network, after training.\n    "}

This all works fine.\nI have deployed the experiment and now want to throw data at it from the front-end of my application. The API-call goes in and comes back with correct results, but it takes up to 30 seconds to calculate a simple linear regression. Sometimes it is 20 seconds, sometimes only 1 second. I even got it down to 100 ms one time (which is what I'd like), but 90% of the time the request takes more than 20 seconds to complete, which is unacceptable.\nI guess it has something to do with it still being an experiment, or it is still in a development slot, but I can't find the settings to get it to run on a faster machine.\nIs there a way to speed up my execution?\nEdit: To clarify: The varying timings are obtained with the same test data, simply by sending the same request multiple times. This made me conclude it must have something to do with my request being put in a queue, there is some start-up latency or I'm throttled in some other way.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First, I am assuming you are doing your timing test on the published AML endpoint.\nWhen a call is made to the AML the first call must warm up the container. By default a web service has 20 containers. Each container is cold, and a cold container can cause a large(30 sec) delay. In the string returned by the AML endpoint, only count requests that have the isWarm flag set to true. By smashing the service with MANY requests(relative to how many containers you have running) can get all your containers warmed.\nIf you are sending out dozens of requests a instance, the endpoint might be getting throttled. You can adjust the number of calls your endpoint can accept by going to manage.windowsazure.com\/\n\nmanage.windowsazure.com\/\nAzure ML Section from left bar\nselect your workspace\ngo to web services tab\nSelect your web service from list\nadjust the number of calls with slider\n\nBy enabling debugging onto your endpoint you can get logs about the execution time for each of your modules to complete. You can use this to determine if a module is not running as you intended which may add to the time.\nOverall, there is an overhead when using the Execute python module, but I'd expect this request to complete in under 3 secs.\n    "}

So the question is how do I sum up all the weights into one singular weight?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First, let's get some terminology clear.  A term is a word-like unit in a corpus.  A token is a term at a particular location in a particular document.  There can be multiple tokens that use the same term.  For example, in my answer, there are many tokens that use the term \"the\".  But there is only one term for \"the\".\nI think you are a little bit confused.  TF-IDF style weighting functions specify how to make a per term score out of the term's token frequency in a document and the background token document frequency in the corpus for each term in a document.  TF-IDF converts a document into a mapping of terms to weights.  So more tokens sharing the same term in a document will increase the corresponding weight for the term, but there will only be one weight per term.  There is no separate score for tokens sharing a term inside the doc.\n    "}

I am assuming this is doable since the matrix is stored via a sparse representation. \nUsefulness: It will help in cases when one has to add additional documents to the training data, and one should not have to start from the beginning.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, this is not possible at present. It's also not \"doable\", and here's why.\nCountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer are designed to turn text documents into vectors. These vectors need to all have an equal number of elements, which in turn is equal to the size of the vocabulary, because that conventions is ingrained in all scikit-learn code. If the vocabulary is allowed to grow, then the vectors produced at various times have different lengths. This affects e.g. the number of parameters in a linear (or other parametric) classifiers trained on such vectors, which then also needs to be able to grow. It affects k-means and dimensionality reduction classes. It even affects something as simple as matrix multiplications, which can no longer be handled with a simple call to NumPy's dot routine, requiring custom code instead. In other words, allowing this flexibility in the vectorizers makes little sense unless you adapt all of scikit-learn to handle the result.\nWhile this would be possible, I (as a core scikit-learn developer) would strongly oppose the change because it makes the code very complicated, probably slower, and even if it would work, it would make it impossible to distinguish between a \"growing vocabulary\" and the much more common situation of a user passing data in the wrong way, so that the number of dimensions comes out wrong.\nIf you want to feed data in in batches, then either using a HashingVectorizer (no vocabulary) or do two passes over the data to collect the vocabulary up front.\n    "}

The output of the last layer of my network will be [bast_size, 1000], so in my case [30, 1000], now do I have to reshape the size of my output to [batch_size, time_steps, features] (in my case: [30, 30, 1000])? Is that correct? or am I wrong?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you merge several small sequences from different videos to form a batch, the output of the last layer of your model (the RNN) should already be [batch_size, window_size, num_classes]. Basically, you want to wrap your CNN with reshape layers which will concatenate the frames from each batch:\n\ninput -> [batch_size, window_size, nchannels, height, width]\nreshape -> [batch_size * window_size, nchannels, height, width]\nCNN -> [batch_size * window_size, feat_size]\nreshape -> [batch_size, window_size, feats_size]\nRNN -> [batch_size, window_size, num_outputs]  (assuming frame-wise predictions)\n\nBut this will take a lot of memory, so you can set batch size to 1, which is what you seem to be doing if I understood correctly. In this case you can spare the first reshape.\nI'm not sure about the order of the axes above, but the general logic remains the same.\nAs a side note: if you plan on using Batch Normalization at some point, you may want to raise the batch size because consecutive frames from a single segment might not contain a lot of variety by themselves. Also give a double check on the batch normalization axes which should cover both time and batch axes.\n    "}

There should not be any performance issue since all that virtualenv does is to load libraries from a specific path rather than load them from the directory where they are saved by default.\nIn any case (this may be completely irrelevant), but if performance is an issue, then perhaps you ought to be looking at a compiled language.

Usually what I do is to take a screenshot of my graph (I almost exclusively make them with matplotlib) and paste it into my PowerPoint.\nUnfortunately my direct superior seems not to be happy with the way I present them. Sometimes he wants certain things in log scale and sometimes he dislike my color palette. The data is all there, but because its an image there's no way I can change that in the meeting. \nMy superior seems to really care about those things and spend quite a lot of time telling me how to make plots in every single meeting. He (usually) will not comment on my data before I make a plot the way he wants.\nThat's where my question becomes relevant. Right now what I have in my mind is to have an interactive canvas embedded in my PowerPoint such that I can change the range of the axis, color of my data point, etc in real time. I have been searching online for such a thing but it comes out empty. I wonder if that could be done and how can it be done?\nFor some simple graphs Excel plot may work, but usually I have to present things in 1D or 2D histograms\/density plots with millions of entries. Sometimes I have to fit points with complicated mathematical formulas and that's something Excel is incapable of doing and I must use scipy and pandas. \nThe closest thing to this I found online is rise with jupyter which convert a jupyter notebook into a slide show. I think that is a good start which allows me to run python code in real time inside the presentation, but I would like to use PowerPoint related solutions if possible, mostly because I am familiar with how PowerPoint works and I still find certain PowerPoint features useful. \nThank you for all your help.

If you decide to link to the picture, you would be free to change it outside of powerpoint. This opens up the possibility for the following workflow:\nNext to your presentation you have a Python IDE or Juypter notebook open with the scripts that generate the figures. They all have a savefig command in them to save to exactly the location on disc from where you link the images in PowerPoint. If you need to change the figure, you make the changes in the python code, run the script (or cell) and switch back to PowerPoint where the newly created image is updated.\nNote that I would not recommend putting too much effort into finding a better solution to this, but rather spend the time thinking about good visual reprentations of the data, due to the following reasons: 1. If your instrutor's demands are completely unreasonable (\"I like blue better than green, so you need to use blue.\") than it's not worth spending effort into satisfying their demands at all. 2. If your instrutor's demands are based on the fact that the current reprentation does not allow to interprete the data correctly, this can be prevented by spending more thoughts on good plots prior to the presentation. This is a learning process, which I guess your instructor wants you to internalize. After all, you won't get a degree in computer science for writing a PowerPoint backend to matplotlib, but rather for being able to present your research in a way suited for your subject.\n    "}

To minimize the error between the transformed input and the target vector samples I'm using a gradient descent algorithm. Later on I want to use the generated matrix to transform vectors coming from the same source as the training input vectors so that they look like the corresponding target vectors. Linear regression, pretty much, but with 3-dimensional targets. \nI can assume that the input and target vectors are in cartesian space. Thus, the transformation matrix should consist of a rotation and a translation. I'm working solely with unit vectors, so I can also safely assume that there's no translation, only rotation. \nSo, in order to get a valid rotation matrix that I can turn into a rotation quaternion I understand that I have to make sure the matrix is orthogonal. \nThus, the question is, is it possible to give Tensorflow some kind of constraint so that the matrix it tries to converge to is guaranteed to be orthogonal? Can be a parameter, a mathematical constraint, a specific optimizer, whatever. I just need to make sure the algorithm converges to a valid rotation matrix.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It should be possible.\nI see two solutions.\nIf you don't care that the transformation is a perfect rotation, you can take the matrix, adjust it to what you think it's a good matrix (make it a perfect rotation) then compute the difference between the one you like and the original and add it as a loss.  With this approach you can push the model to do what you want but the model might not converge on a perfect rotation, especially if a perfect rotation is not a very good solution.\nAnother approach is to start with a proper rotation matrix and train the parameters of the rotation. In this case you would have the x,y,z of the rotation axis and the amount of rotation. So declare these as variables, compute the rotation matrix and use that in your model. The operations are derivable so gradient descent should work, but depending on the data itself you might depend on the start position (so try a few times).\nHard to say which one will work best in your case, so it might be worth trying both.\n    "}

If the problem is inside a function you could catch the exception and return all relevant objects. Or you could also put your functions inside the class to have a single object, instantiate and run it from jupyter and when the problem occurs you will have all variables inside that class object.\nAdding assert's statements for the shapes of your data and for the shapes of your model variables\/placeholders. For example, if you have some preprocessing\/augmentation add assert's before and after preprocessing\/augmentation to be sure that the shapes are as expected.\nTaking a break. Sometimes you spend a lot of time and effort on something without success, but after having a rest you solve the problem immediately.\n\nGood luck!\n    "}

I use anaconda, so it was located in anaconda\/lib\/site-packages\/python2.7\/matplotlib.\nTo change the histogram style I edited two of the files. Assuming that the current directory is matplotlib\/, then open up axes\/_axes.py and locate the hist() function there (it's on line 5690 on my machine, matplotlib version 1.5.1). You should see the histtype argument there. Change this to 'step'.\nNow open up pyplot.py and again locate the hist() function and make the same change to the histtype argument (line 2943 in version 1.5.1 and on my machine). There is a comment about not editing this function, but I only found this to be an issue when I didn't also edit axes\/_axes.py as well.\nThis worked for me! Another alternative would be just to write a wrapper around hist() yourself that changes the default argument.\n    "}

Here is how I feel confused:\n\nwe have objective, which is the loss function needs to be minimized; eval_metric: the metric used to represent the learning result. These two are totally unrelated (if we don't consider such as for classification only logloss and mlogloss can be used as eval_metric). Is this correct? If I am, then for a classification problem, how you can use rmse as a performance metric?\ntake two options for objective as an example, reg:logistic and binary:logistic. For 0\/1 classifications, usually binary logistic loss, or cross entropy should be considered as the loss function, right? So which of the two options is for this loss function, and what's the value of the other one? Say, if binary:logistic represents the cross entropy loss function, then what does reg:logistic do?\nwhat's the difference between multi:softmax and multi:softprob? Do they use the same loss function and just differ in the output format? If so, that should be the same for reg:logistic and binary:logistic as well, right?\n\nsupplement for the 2nd problem\nsay, the loss function for 0\/1 classification problem should be\nL = sum(y_i*log(P_i)+(1-y_i)*log(P_i)). So if I need to choose binary:logistic here, or reg:logistic to let xgboost classifier to use L loss function. If it is binary:logistic, then what loss function reg:logistic uses?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>'binary:logistic' uses -(y*log(y_pred) + (1-y)*(log(1-y_pred)))\n'reg:logistic' uses (y - y_pred)^2\nTo get a total estimation of error we sum all errors and divide by number of samples.\n\nYou can find this in the basics. When looking on Linear regression VS Logistic regression.\nLinear regression uses (y - y_pred)^2 as the Cost Function\nLogistic regression uses -(y*log(y_pred) + (y-1)*(log(1-y_pred))) as the Cost function\n\nEvaluation metrics are completely different thing. They design to evaluate your model. You can be confused by them because it is logical to use some evaluation metrics that are the same as the loss function, like MSE in regression problems. However, in binary problems it is not always wise to look at the logloss. My experience have thought me (in classification problems) to generally look on AUC ROC.\nEDIT\n\naccording to xgboost documentation:\n\nreg:linear: linear regression\n\n\nreg:logistic: logistic regression\n\n\nbinary:logistic: logistic regression for binary classification, output\nprobability\n\nSo I'm guessing:\nreg:linear: is as we said, (y - y_pred)^2\nreg:logistic is -(y*log(y_pred) + (y-1)*(log(1-y_pred))) and rounding predictions with 0.5 threshhold\nbinary:logistic is plain -(y*log(y_pred) + (1-y)*(log(1-y_pred))) (returns the probability)\nYou can test it out and see if it do as I've edited.

However, this does not take into account several things: the generalization capabilities of models that use those hyperparameters, the effort to use Bayesian optimization compared to the much simpler random search, and the possibility to use random search in parallel.\nSo in conclusion, my recommendation is: never use grid search, use random search if you just want to try a few hyperparameters and can try them in parallel (or if you want the hyperparameters to generalize to different problems), and use Bayesian optimization if you want the best results and are willing to use a more advanced method.\n[1] Random Search for Hyper-Parameter Optimization, Bergstra & Bengio 2012.\n[2] Bayesian Optimization is Superior to Random Search for Machine Learning Hyperparameter Tuning: Analysis of the Black-Box Optimization Challenge 2020, Turner et al. 2021.\n    "}

If this is the case, you can add a small number like 1e-8 to your output probability.\nYou have bad inputs. If this is the case, make sure that you do not feed your model with NaNs. i.e. use assert not np.any(np.isnan(x)) on the input data.\nYour labels are not in the same domain of your objective function. If this is the case, check the range of your labels and make sure they match.\n\nIf none of the above helps, try to check the activation function, the optimizer, the loss function, the size and the shape of the network.\nFinally, though less likely, there might be a bug with the framework you are using.

However, simply setting seed \"random.seed(55)\" does not appear to work, changing the original code \"from random import ....\" to \"import random\" doesn't help, nor does changing Random().  These all seem to do approximately the same thing, the trees start out building the same, then diverge.\nIn reading various entries about the behavior of random, I can find no reason, given his GP code, why this divergence should happen.  There doesn't appear to be anything in the code except calls to random, that has any variability that would account for this behavior.  My understanding is that calling random.seed() should set all the calls correctly and since the code isn't threaded at all, I'm not sure how or why the divergence is happening.\nHas anyone modified this code to behave reproducibly? Is there some form of calling random.seed() that may work better?\nI apologize for not posting an example, but the code is obviously not mine (I'm adding only the call to seed and changing how random is called in the code) and this doesn't appear to be a simple issue with random (I've read all the entries on Python random here and many on the web in general).\nThanks.\nMark L.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I had the same problem just now with some completely unrelated code.

The data is provided to me in a json file and every 100 milliseconds (so 10 times a second), it knows where the players on both sides of the court are and where the ball is and provides other match data as well. Using this tracking data, I created a bunch of custom python classes and subclasses to create a \"match\" object and I am loading all of the tracking data into this \"match object.\" Can I create a pandas df holding instances of custom classes\/does this make sense? \n\nBackstory\/thought process (in case my question doesn't make sense which is highly possible...)\nThe first time I implemented this I basically created a \"match\" object where I used python OOP and had the match broken into games, sets, points, players, etc. The players part is a little confusing because due to calculations on my end we created a player object and a new instance of a player every 100 milliseconds (it's hard to wrap your head around because one player is the same throughout the game, but think of it as that player at that exact moment in time). I'm not sure if it makes more sense to change these \"player\" objects instead into rows in a pandas dataframe (they're are a ton of them, think about a 3 hour match) or instead if I can just create a pandas df and have a player be a column. Players make up points and then points make up frames, so if I did change the player objects to a pandas df it would be hard because than I would have a bunch of rows in the dataframe making up a point and then a bunch of points making up a game.. and whatnot\nBecause there is so much tracking data, efficiency considerations are important to me (although I prefer to do things something somewhat slower but not drastically but it helps me ensure\/check all data)\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A DataFrame's columns (Series) can have any of the NumPy dtypes, including object, which can hold arbitrary Python objects.\nDoing so gives up most of the speed and space benefits of using NumPy\/Pandas in the first place. And also the type checking—if you accidentally insert an object that isn't an instance of a match subclass, it will just work. And many convenience features. \nBut you do still get some convenience features, and sometimes that's a more than good enough reason to use Pandas.\nIf the performance isn't acceptable, though, you will have to rethink things. For example, if you flatten the object out into a set of attributes (maybe some of them NaN or N\/A for some of the subclasses) that you can store as a row, especially if some of those attributes are things like floats or ints that you want to do a lot of computation on, you'll get a lot more out of Pandas—but at the cost of losing the OO benefits of your classes, of course.\nOccasionally, it's worth building a hybrid to get the best of both worlds: a DataFrame whose rows hold the storage for your match objects, but then also a match class hierarchy that holds an index or even a single-row DataFrame (a slice from the main one) and provides an OO view onto the same information. But more often, it isn't worth the work to do this, as either almost all of your code ends up being Pandas or almost all of it ends up being OO.\nOne last possibility, if there are huge numbers of these things, would be an ORM that uses a relational database, or an old-school hierarchical database,1 for storage and indexing.\n\n1. In fact, building a hierarchical database out of a bunch of DataFrames and then wrapping it in an object model is basically the same thing as the previous paragraph, but the idea here is that you use stuff that's already built to do all the hard and\/or tedious stuff, not that you build a database just to hide it from yourself.\n    "}

Simply assign to a slice of a dataset variable, and optionally call the dataset .sync() method afterward to ensure no delay before those changes are flushed to the file. \nNote this approach also provides the opportunity to progressively grow a dimension of the array (by calling createDimension with size None, making it the first dimension of a variable, and iteratively assigning to incrementally larger indices along that dimension of the variable).\nAlthough random-access window (i.e. subset) writes appear to require the lower level package, more systematic subset writes (eventually covering the entire array) can be done incrementally with xarray (by specifying a chunk size parameter to trigger use of the dask.array backend), and provided that your algorithm is refactored so that the main loop occurs in the dask\/xarray store-to-file call. This means you will not have explicit control over the sequence in which chunks are generated and written.\n    "}

Normally, you want to seed only once at the beginning of the program, at least in a single-threaded program.

But i will be using these libraries to work with my org data. The question is while using these libraries 'do they make API calls to process the data' or is the data taken out of the python shell to be processed. It is a security question, so was wondering if someone has any documentation for reference.\nAppreciate any help on this.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Generally with NLTK, gensim, and scikit-learn, algorithms are implemented in their source code, and run locally on your data, without sending data elsehwere for processing. \nI've never noticed any documentation\/functionality of these packages mentioning a reliance on an remote\/cloud service, nor seen users discussing the same. \nHowever, they're each large libraries, with many functions I've never reviewed, and with many contributors adding new options. And I don't know if the project leads have stated an explicit commitment to never rely on external services. \nSo a definitive, permanent answer may not be possible. To the extent such security is a concern for your project, you should carefully review the documentation, and even source code, for those functions\/classes\/methods you're using. (None of these projects would intentionally hide a reliance on outside services.)\nYou could also develop, test, and deploy the code on systems whose ability to contact outside services is limited by firewalls – so that you could detect and block any undisclosed or inadvertent communication with outside machines. \nNote also that each of these libraries in turn relies on other public libraries. If your concern also extends to the potential for either careless or intentionally, maliciously-inserted methods of private data exfiltration, you would want to do a deeper analysis of these libraries & all other libraries they bring-in. (Simply trusting the top-level documentation could be insufficient.) \nAlso, each of these libraries have utility functions which, on explicit user demand, download example datasets or shared non-code resources (like lists of stopwords or lexicons). Using such functions doesn't upload any of your data elsewhere, but may leak that you're using specific functionality. The firewall-based approach mentioned above could interfere with such download steps. Under a situation of maximum vigilance\/paranoia, you might want pay special attention to the use & behavior of such extra-download methods, to be sure they're not doing any more than they should to change the local environment or execute\/replace other library code. \nFinally, by sticking to widely-used packages\/functions, and somewhat older versions that have remained continuously available, you may benefit from a bit of \"community assurance\" that a package's behavior is well-understood, without surprising dependencies or vulnerabilities. That is, many other users will have already given those code-paths some attention, analysis, & real-usage – so any problems may have already been discovered, disclosed, and fixed.\n    "}

Initially I tried different versions of each required library, as I thought it might be a GPU issue, but I've since tried to simplify by installing cpu-only versions.\n\nPython 3.9.12 (main, Apr  5 2022, 06:56:58) \n[GCC 7.5.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import torch\n>>> import torch_scatter\n>>> import torch_cluster\n>>> import torch_sparse\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nAnd the same issue, presumably due to torch_sparse, when importing pytorch_geometric:\nPython 3.9.12 (main, Apr  5 2022, 06:56:58) \n[GCC 7.5.0] :: Anaconda, Inc. on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import torch_geometric\nSegmentation fault (core dumped)\n\nI'm on an Ubuntu distribution:\nDistributor ID:    Ubuntu\nDescription:    Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS\nRelease:    22.04\nCodename:   jammy\n\nHere's my (lightweight for DL) conda installs:\n# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel\n_libgcc_mutex             0.1                        main  \n_openmp_mutex             5.1                       1_gnu  \nblas                      1.0                         mkl  \nbrotlipy                  0.7.0           py310h7f8727e_1002  \nbzip2                     1.0.8                h7b6447c_0  \nca-certificates           2022.07.19           h06a4308_0  \ncertifi                   2022.9.24       py310h06a4308_0  \ncffi                      1.15.1          py310h74dc2b5_0  \ncharset-normalizer        2.0.4              pyhd3eb1b0_0  \ncpuonly                   2.0                           0    pytorch\ncryptography              37.0.1          py310h9ce1e76_0  \nfftw                      3.3.9                h27cfd23_1  \nidna                      3.4             py310h06a4308_0  \nintel-openmp              2021.4.0          h06a4308_3561  \njinja2                    3.0.3              pyhd3eb1b0_0  \njoblib                    1.1.1           py310h06a4308_0  \nld_impl_linux-64          2.38                 h1181459_1  \nlibffi                    3.3                  he6710b0_2  \nlibgcc-ng                 11.2.0               h1234567_1  \nlibgfortran-ng            11.2.0               h00389a5_1  \nlibgfortran5              11.2.0               h1234567_1  \nlibgomp                   11.2.0               h1234567_1  \nlibstdcxx-ng              11.2.0               h1234567_1  \nlibuuid                   1.0.3                h7f8727e_2  \nmarkupsafe                2.1.1           py310h7f8727e_0  \nmkl                       2021.4.0           h06a4308_640  \nmkl-service               2.4.0           py310h7f8727e_0  \nmkl_fft                   1.3.1           py310hd6ae3a3_0  \nmkl_random                1.2.2           py310h00e6091_0  \nncurses                   6.3                  h5eee18b_3  \nnumpy                     1.23.3          py310hd5efca6_0  \nnumpy-base                1.23.3          py310h8e6c178_0  \nopenssl                   1.1.1q               h7f8727e_0  \npip                       22.2.2          py310h06a4308_0  \npycparser                 2.21               pyhd3eb1b0_0  \npyg                       2.1.0           py310_torch_1.12.0_cpu    pyg\npyopenssl                 22.0.0             pyhd3eb1b0_0  \npyparsing                 3.0.9           py310h06a4308_0  \npysocks                   1.7.1           py310h06a4308_0  \npython                    3.10.6               haa1d7c7_0  \npytorch                   1.12.1             py3.10_cpu_0    pytorch\npytorch-cluster           1.6.0           py310_torch_1.12.0_cpu    pyg\npytorch-mutex             1.0                         cpu    pytorch\npytorch-scatter           2.0.9           py310_torch_1.12.0_cpu    pyg\npytorch-sparse            0.6.15          py310_torch_1.12.0_cpu    pyg\nreadline                  8.1.2                h7f8727e_1  \nrequests                  2.28.1          py310h06a4308_0  \nscikit-learn              1.1.2           py310h6a678d5_0  \nscipy                     1.9.1           py310hd5efca6_0  \nsetuptools                63.4.1          py310h06a4308_0  \nsix                       1.16.0             pyhd3eb1b0_1  \nsqlite                    3.39.3               h5082296_0  \nthreadpoolctl             2.2.0              pyh0d69192_0  \ntk                        8.6.12               h1ccaba5_0  \ntqdm                      4.64.1          py310h06a4308_0  \ntyping_extensions         4.3.0           py310h06a4308_0  \ntzdata                    2022e                h04d1e81_0  \nurllib3                   1.26.12         py310h06a4308_0  \nwheel                     0.37.1             pyhd3eb1b0_0  \nxz                        5.2.6                h5eee18b_0  \nzlib                      1.2.13               h5eee18b_0  \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I've found a combination of packages that works for me - hopefully someone else will have this issue at some point and be able to reproduce the steps from me talking to myself here. The full process for getting stuff working was:\n\nFresh conda environment with forced Python=3.9 (conda create -n ENVNAME python=3.9)\nActivate that environment\nInstall basic python packages (conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn)\nCheck CUDA version if working with a GPU (nvidia-smi in terminal prints these details for NVIDIA cards)\nInstall Pytorch using their suggested conda command (conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=CUDA_VERSION -c pytorch -c conda-forge). This had to go through the env solving process on my machine.\nInstall pytorch geometric (or just torch sparse if that's all you need) with conda install pyg -c pyg. Again this had a solving process.\nCheck that torch_sparse imports without fault\n\nHere's the conda list for this working combination of packages:\n# Name                    Version

At the root level, it only has one node. Also, assume that the root node only has one child instead of 2. So at the next depth, there is only one node instead of 2. which means that at the next depth, there will be only two nodes instead of 4. in the next depth, there will be eight instead of 16.\nSo yeah is there any way I can foretell the number of nodes there will be at a given depth based on the number of nodes present or not present in the previous depth.\nAny kind of answer would do if there is a mathematical formula that will help. If you know a way I could do it iteratively in breadth-first search order in any programming language that would help too.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If you know the number of nodes at depth 𝑑 is 𝑛, then the number of nodes at depth 𝑑 + 1 lies between 0 and 2𝑛.

So far it seems to be working fine, but I have a weird problem and I'm quite confident that it's not caused by my code. I've googled around and this problem seems to be quite unique, but maybe one of you guys can point me in the right direction:\nI am displaying a few steps of my lane detection algorithm in different windows (e.g. ROI, detected lines...), and every few seconds, depending on the current framerate, the image will randomly flip to being upside down in some of the windows (only one at a time and only for a single\/few frames), except for the main window where I am controlling the car (manually for now). I've tried setting the Unreal Editor to different framerates, and there is definitely a connection between the output framerate (server side) and the amount of these \"flips\" happening, to the point where it's almost never happening if I run it at 15-20fps. There is also some \"tearing\" going on (e.g. only roughly the upper half of the image is flipped, like Vsynch is switched off) sometimes, which leads me to believe that the root cause is somewhere in the rendering part and not the python scripts. The point is: when the image is upside down, my lane detection is seeing the \"lane\" in the wrong place, which could lead to all sorts of trouble down the line.\nTo be honest I'm not that familiar with the whole Unreal Engine\/DirectX(?)-rendering pipeline, so I am a little lost what might be causing this issue. I'm grateful for any ideas on how to fix this, thanks in advance!\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Okay, in case anybody ever has the same problem, here's what I found out:\nthe client was running too fast in relation to the server. I limited the client side to 30fps now and that fixed it. This issue will only occur if the tick rate of the client is so high that it has trouble keeping up while running the calculations in the background.\nI still can't figure out why the image is upside down in that case, but hey...\n    "}

Which one is preferred over the other?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You can get the same results with both. LassoCV makes it easier by letting you pass an array of alpha-values to alphas as well as a cross validation parameter directly into the classifier.\nTo do the same thing with GridSearchCV, you would have to pass it a Lasso classifier a grid of alpha-values (i.e. {'alpha':[.5, 1, 5]}) and the CV parameter.\nI would not recommend one over the other though. The only advantage I can see is that you can access results_ as well as many other attributes if you use GridSearchCV. This may be helpful if you want a summary of all the models returned by the alphas you tried. On the other hand, as pointed out by @amiola, LassoCV can take advantage of using pre-computed results in previous steps of the cross-validation process (aka warm-starting), which may result in faster fitting times.\n    "}

I've imported the node\/edge data from OSMnx and am trying to solve the model with Gurobi Optimizer in Python.\nTo be able to use the OSMnx data with Gurobi, I created a matrix = len(nodes) x len(nodes) matrix and therein printed the length of the edge if two nodes were connected, and a large number otherwise. In the optimization, a x[i,j] = len(nodes) x len(nodes) binary decision variable is used to decide if an edge is traversed or not.\nThe problem I am encountering is a large computing time for just one request (+1 hour).

Upon submission of new document by user, our goal is to inform him about possible duplication of existing document (just like stackoverflow suggests questions may already have answer).\nIn our system, new document is uploaded every minute and mostly about the same topic (where there are more chance of duplication).\nOur current implementation includes gensim doc2vec model trained on documents (tagged with unique document ids). We infer vector for new document and find most_similar docs (ids) with it. Reason behind choosing doc2vec model is that we wanted to take advantage of semantics to improve results. As far as we know, it does not support online training, so we might have to schedule a cron or something that periodically updates the model. But scheduling cron will be disadvantageous as documents come in a burst. User may upload duplicates while model is not yet trained for new data. Also given huge amount of data, training time will be higher.\nSo i would like to know how such cases are handled in big companies. Are there any better alternative? or better algorithm for such problem?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You don't have to take the old model down to start training a new model, so despite any training lags, or new-document bursts, you'll always have a live model doing the best it can.\nDepending on how much the document space changes over time, you might find retraining to have a negligible benefit. (One good model, built on a large historical record, might remain fine for inferring new vectors indefinitely.)\nNote that tuning inference to use more steps (especially for short documents), or a lower starting alpha (more like the training default of 0.025) may give better results. \nIf word-vectors are available, there is also the \"Word Mover's Distance\"  (WMD) calculation of document similarity, which might be ever better at identifying close duplicates. Note, though, it can be quite expensive to calculate – you might want to do it only against a subset of likely candidates, or have to add many parallel processors, to do it in bulk. There's another newer distance metric called 'soft cosine similarity' (available in recent gensim) that's somewhere between simple vector-to-vector cosine-similarity and full WMD in its complexity, that may be worth trying. \nTo the extent the vocabulary hasn't expanded, you can load an old Doc2Vec model, and continue to train() it – and starting from an already working model may help you achieve similar results with fewer passes. But note: it currently doesn't support learning any new words, and the safest practice is to re-train with a mix of all known examples interleaved. (If you only train on incremental new examples, the model may lose a balanced understanding of the older documents that aren't re-presented.)\n(If you chief concern is documents that duplicate exact runs-of-words, rather than just similar fuzzy topics, you might look at mixing-in other techniques, such as breaking a document into a bag-of-character-ngrams, or 'shingleprinting' as in common in plagiarism-detection applications.)\n    "}

It does fine in many domains where there are lots of weak clues (as in \"overlapping words\"), but no absolutes. It all depends on the features you pass it. I'm guessing you are blindly passing it the usual \"bag of words\" features, perhaps after filtering for stopwords. Well, if that's not working, try a little harder. \nA good approach is to read a couple of hundred tweets and see how you know which category you are looking at. That'll tell you what kind of things you need to distill into features. But be sure to look at lots of data, and focus on the general patterns.\nAn example (but note that I haven't looked at your corpus): Time expressions may be good clues on whether you are pre- or post-sale, but they take some work to detect. Create some features \"past expression\", \"future expression\", etc. (in addition to bag-of-words features), and see if that helps. Of course you'll need to figure out how to detect them first, but you don't have to be perfect: You're after anything that can help the classifier make a better guess. \"Past tense\" would probably be a good feature to try, too.\n    "}

Thanks much in advance.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This is a time formatting problem\/philosophy by Excel.  For some reason, Microsoft prefers to hide seconds and sub-seconds on user displays:   even MSDOS's dir command omitted seconds.\nIf I were you, I'd use Excel's format operation and set it to display seconds, then save the spreadsheet as CSV and see if it put anything in it to record the improved formatting.\nIf that doesn't work, you might explore creating a macro which does the formatting, or use one of the IPC to Excel to command it to do your bidding.\n    "}
{"text":"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n    Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\n    Today Date: 1 January 2025\n\n    You are a helpful ML assistant\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm trying to build a multilabel-classifier to predict the probabilities of some input data being either 0 or 1. I'm using a neural network and Tensorflow + Keras (maybe a CNN later).\nThe problem is the following: \nThe data is highly skewed. There are a lot more negative examples than positive maybe 90:10. So my neural network nearly always outputs very low probabilities for positive examples. Using binary numbers it would predict 0 in most of the cases.\nThe performance is > 95% for nearly all classes, but this is due to the fact that it nearly always predicts zero...\nTherefore the number of false negatives is very high.\nSome suggestions how to fix this?\nHere are the ideas I considered so far:\n\nPunishing false negatives more with a customized loss function (my first attempt failed). Similar to class weighting positive examples inside a class more than negative ones. This is similar to class weights but within a class.\nHow would you implement this in Keras? \nOversampling positive examples by cloning them and then overfitting the neural network such that positive and negative examples are balanced.\n\nThanks in advance!\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're on the right track.\nUsually, you would either balance your data set before training, i.e. reducing the over-represented class or generate artificial (augmented) data for the under-represented class to boost its occurrence.\n\nReduce over-represented class\nThis one is simpler, you would just randomly pick as many samples as there are in the under-represented class, discard the rest and train with the new subset. The disadvantage of course is that you're losing some learning potential, depending on how complex (how many features) your task has.\nAugment data\nDepending on the kind of data you're working with, you can \"augment\" data. That just means that you take existing samples from your data and slightly modify them and use them as additional samples. This works very well with image data, sound data. You could flip\/rotate, scale, add-noise, in-\/decrease brightness, scale, crop etc.\nThe important thing here is that you stay within bounds of what could happen in the real world. If for example you want to recognize a \"70mph speed limit\" sign, well, flipping it doesn't make sense, you will never encounter an actual flipped 70mph sign. If you want to recognize a flower, flipping or rotating it is permissible. Same for sound, changing volume \/ frequency slighty won't matter much. But reversing the audio track changes its \"meaning\" and you won't have to recognize backwards spoken words in the real world.\n\nNow if you have to augment tabular data like sales data, metadata, etc... that's much trickier as you have to be careful not to implicitly feed your own assumptions into the model.\n    "}

In short, what I am trying to accomplish is to populate the total_fold_array with 5 individual folds, which each contain a number of rows from a dataset.\nAn example of the current_fold_array might be [A,B,C,D], so then ultimately, I have a total_fold_array which has 5 of those individual folds, which would look like [[A,B,C,D,],[A,B,B,C],[A,A,A,A],[B,C,D,D],[B,B,B,C]]\nHowever, this loop does not do that. Instead, it creates total_fold_array with the length of whatever the length of classes is (in this case 7), instead of having 5 folds within.\nMy code is below:\nI am currently getting a total_fold_array containing 7 items, when instead, it should contain 5. Each item within can have as many items as needed, but the total_fold_array should be 5 items long. I believe there is a logic bug in my code, and I am looking for some help.

That seems totally unnecessary -- I think that while loop will execute exactly once. You are returning from that function before the second iteration of that while loop can happen. My guess is that you introduced that while loop hoping that it would somehow limit the number of elements in total_fold_array to 5. But that's not going to happen, because, inside that while loop, the for loop grows total_fold_array to have 7 elements, and this happens in the very first iteration of the while loop.\n    "}

I think this is because it's done through the SSH X-server.\nMy question is how to manually make the figure interactions graphically (using mouse, like zooming, panning, rotation, ...) execute faster? I think this should be via allowing the figure interactions to happen on local machine (machine running PyCharm), not the remote server.\nOne workaround is to save a .fig file, then copy it to my local machine, then load it. But I don't prefer this workaround.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Interacting with visualisations on separate windows is slow, not just on PyCharm but any IDE that you specify visualisations to be loaded separately. This is because they are loaded on either tkinter or any of the available modules like Qt5 and if you're on a mac, you can also use the inbuilt OSX rendering. Especially if your dataset is large then interaction becomes slower. It just seems that visualisations in Python are not exactly that optimised as you witness on Tableau or even Orange\/Glue.\nThat's why I personally prefer visualising data inline through the IPython console (for that I use Spyder). You cannot interact with plots though, but the purpose suffices.\n    "}

Only a few versions of python are compatible with it, the same thing with numpy, and if you want to use NVIDIA GPUs, good luck figuring out the specific versions of cuda and cudnn.\nYou don't want to have to tailor most of the python-related software on your machine to running tensorflow. In order to avoid breaking it whenever you install something that requires a higher version of numpy, for example, it is best to keep it in a separate environment.

I do know the origin and destination of the entire path. There may be some segments that cannot be included in the path as their start or end node cannot be connected to the previous or next node to form that continuous path. These segments should be removed from the rearranged list of tuples.\nExample:\nThe list of tuples may look like the following. Also, I know that the path should start at 101 and end at 205.\n[(101, 203), (104, 202), (203, 104), (104, 208), (185, 205), (202, 185)]\nExpected Results:\n[(101, 203), (203, 104), (104, 202), (202, 185), (185, 205)]\nI would like to solve this in Python. My understanding is that this can be solved using a loop that looks at the end node ID of each segment, finds a segment with a similar start node ID, and adds that append that segment to the list of rearranged tuples.

You didn't really make it clear of what conditions the resultant path must satisfy so I assume any continuous path is fine.\nIn such a case, this question can simply be framed as a shortest path question, so you just need to find the shortest path between node 101 and 205, and the weight of each vertice is just 1 if the node tuple exist in the set, else infinity. So for example. the vertice between 203 and 104 is 1 since (203, 104) is in the original list, on the other hand the weight between 203 and 208 is infinity, since the vertice doesn't exist. You can then apply the standard Dijkstra shortest path algorithm to obtain the nodes traversed and therefore the tuples.\nEdit\n\nI think I misunderstood what you are trying to do, so I think you are actually trying to include as many nodes as possible for the path created. In such a case, perhaps something like breadth first search would be possible, where you keep track of all possible paths and keep deleting those that have no further possible connections.\n    "}

You would find, if you made the chunk size too small, that some partitions would contain no data.\nParquet is not structured like this. Its fundamental non-splittable chunk is the \"row-group\", and there is often just one row group per data file. This is done for efficiency: encoding and compressing a whole row group's worth of data in one block will give maximum read throughput. Furthermore, because of the encoding and compression, it's much harder for dask to guess how big a piece of a dataset will be as an in-memory pandas dataframe, but it can be many times bigger.\nA row group could easily be >>100MB in size. In fact, this is generally recommended, as smaller pieces will have a higher fraction of their processing time in overhead and latency.\nTo summarize\n\ndask will not split a parquet dataset beyond the partitioning within the data files\nthat partition size might be many times larger in memory than on disk, so repartitioning after load may result in many partitions\nthese are tradeoffs required to make parquet as fast and space-efficient as it is\n    "}

To me, those arguments have the same function and the fact that they have different names is a bit confusing. Actually, size seems a bit off since it really specifies the .shape of the output.\nIs there a reason for having different names, do they convey a different meaning even though they both end up being equal to the .shape of the output?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Because you are working with a numpy array, which was seen as a C array, size refers to how big your array will be. Moreover, if you can pass np.zeros(10) or np.zeros((10)). While the difference is subtle, size passed this way will create you a 1D array. You can give size=(n1, n2, ..., nn) which will create an nD array.\nHowever, because python users want multi-dimensional arrays, array.reshape allows you to get from 1D to an nD array. So, when you call shape, you get the N dimension shape of the array, so you can see exactly how your array looks like. \nIn essence, size is equal to the product of the elements of shape.\nEDIT: The difference in name can be attributed to 2 parts: firstly, you can initialise your array with a size. However, you do not know the shape of it. So size is only for total number of elements. Secondly, how numpy was developed, different people worked on different parts of the code, giving different names to roughly the same element, depending on their personal vision for the code.\n    "}

Simple question about sklearn's random forest: \nFor a true\/false classification problem, is there a way in sklearn's random forest to specify the sample size used to train each tree, along with the ratio of true to false observations?\nMore details are below:\n\nIn the R implementation of random forest, called randomForest, there's an option sampsize(). This allows you to balance the sample used to train each tree based on the outcome. \nFor example, if you're trying to predict whether an outcome is true or false and 90% of the outcomes in the training set are false, you can set sampsize(500, 500). This means that each tree will be trained on a random sample (with replacement) from the training set with 500 true and 500 false observations. In these situations, I've found models perform much better predicting true outcomes when using a 50% cut-off, yielding much higher kappas. \nIt doesn't seem like there is an option for this in the sklearn implementation. \n\nIs there any way to mimic this functionality in sklearn? \nWould simply optimizing the cut-off based on the Kappa statistic achieve a similar result or is something lost in this approach?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In version 0.16-dev, you can now use class_weight=\"auto\" to have something close to what you want to do.

Now imagine adding an additional column to your data for which your model has not been trained, as would be the case with a new category... this will result in sub-optimal performance. Most likely, this new column will have no affect on the model prediction. \nThere are examples of what you are suggesting, but they require a secondary model be fed into a primary model. We see this often in Natural Language Processing, where there is a model for how texts are similar (a word vector) and this model is then fed into another model that predicts things like text category and sentiment. \nSo basically, if you can model the similarities of your categorical variables (this is your secondary model), and feed that model into primary model, then you would only need update your secondary model when you get new data.

This question is mostly intended as a sanity check to ensure that I'm doing this in the most efficient way, and that my math is actually sound (since my statistics knowledge is not completely perfect).\nAnyways, some explanation about what I'm trying to do:\nI have a lot of time series data that I would like to perform some linear regressions on. In particular, I have roughly 2000 observations on 500 different variables. For each variable, I need to perform a regression using two explanatory variables (two additional vectors of roughly 2000 observations). So for each of 500 different Y's, I would need to find a and b in the following regression Y = aX_1 + bX_2 + e.\nUp until this point, I have been using the OLS function in the statsmodels package to perform my regressions. However, as far as I can tell, if I wanted to use the statsmodels package to accomplish my problem, I would have to call it hundreds of times, which just seems generally inefficient.\nSo instead, I decided to revisit some statistics that I haven't really touched in a long time. If my knowledge is still correct, I can put all of my observations into one large Y matrix that is roughly 2000 x 500. I can then stick my explanatory variables into an X matrix that is roughly 2000 x 2, and get the results of all 500 of my regressions by calculating (X'Y)\/(X'X). If I do this using basic numpy stuff (matrix multiplication using * and inverses using matrix.I), I'm guessing it will be much faster than doing hundreds of statsmodel OLS calls.\nHere are the questions that I have:\n\nIs the numpy stuff that I am doing faster than the earlier method of calling statsmodels many times? If so, is it the fastest\/most efficient way to accomplish what I want? I'm assuming that it is, but if you know of a better way then I would be happy to hear it. (Surely I'm not the first person to need to calculate many regressions in this way.)\nHow do I deal with missing data in my matrices? My time series data is not going to be nice and complete, and will be missing values occasionally. If I just try to do regular matrix multiplication in numpy, the NA values will propagate and I'll end up with a matrix of mostly NAs as my end result. If I do each regression independently, I can just drop the rows containing NAs before I perform my regression, but if I do this on the large 2000 x 500 matrix I will end up dropping actual, non-NA data from some of my other variables, and I obviously don't want that to happen.\nWhat is the most efficient way to ensure that my time series data actually lines up correctly before I put it into the matrices in the first place? The start and end dates for my observations are not necessarily the same, and some series might have days that others do not. If I were to pick a method for doing this, I would put all the observations into a pandas data frame indexed by the date. Then pandas will end up doing all of the work aligning everything for me and I can extract the underlying ndarray after it is done. Is this the best method, or does pandas have some sort of overhead that I can avoid by doing the matrix construction in a different way?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>some brief answers\n1) Calling statsmodels repeatedly is not the fastest way. If we just need parameters, prediction and residual and we have identical explanatory variables, then I usually just use params = pinv(x).dot(y) where y is 2 dimensional and calculate the rest from there. The problem is that inference, confidence intervals and similar require work, so unless speed is crucial and only a restricted set of results is required, statsmodels OLS is still more convenient.\nThis only works if all y and x have the same observations indices, no missing values and no gaps.\nAside: The setup is a Multivariate Linear Model which will be supported by statsmodels in, hopefully not very far, future.\n2) and 3) The fast simple linear algebra of case 1) does not work if there are missing cells or no complete overlap of observation (indices). In the analog to panel data, the first case requires \"balanced\" panels, the other cases imply \"unbalanced\" data. The standard way is to stack the data with the explanatory variables in a block-diagonal form. Since this increases the memory by a large amount, using sparse matrices and sparse linear algebra is better. It depends on the specific cases whether building and solving the sparse problem is faster than looping over individual OLS regressions. \nSpecialized code: (Just a thought):\nIn case 2) with not fully overlapping or cellwise missing values, we would still need to calculate all x'x, and x'y matrices for all y, i.e. 500 of those. Given that you only have two regressors 500 x 2 x 2 would still not require a large memory. So it might be possible to calculate params, prediction and residuals by using the non-missing mask as weights in the cross-product calculations.\nnumpy has vectorized linalg.inv, as far as I know. So, I think, this could be done with a few vectorized calculations.\n    "}

It is also like moving your point in a hyper-spaces that the loss function gives a small loss on that point. \nSmaller loss means higher accruacy in general.\nChanging Weights\nSo now, changing your parameters values, by mistake or by purpose, is like moving that point to somewhere BUT you have no logical reason behind that such move will give you a smaller loss. You are just randomly wandering around that hyper-space and in your case you are just lucky that you land to some point that so happened give you a smaller loss or a better testing accuracy. It is just purely luck.\nChanging activation function\nAlso, altering the activation function from leakyRelu to relu is similar you randomly alter the shape of your hype-space. Even though you are at the some point the landscape changes, you are still have no logical reason to believe by such change of landscape you can have a smaller loss staying at the same point\nWhen you change the model manually, you need to retrain.\n    "}

For example in the Roboschool Reacher environment, 2 torque values - one for each axis - must be specify at each time step. The problem is that the Q matrix is built from (state, action) pairs.

Then break your list in equal chunks, I mean list of list [[id1, id2, id3], [id4, id5, id6] ... ] and do a for loop for sub-list in list: db.xyz.find({'key':{'$in': sublist}}, {'_id': 1}) and use the sub list as parameter in $in operator.

HoloViews only links axes that are the same, and it sounds like you're plotting different quantities on the y axis in each plot. In that case, the real fix is to put in a real name for the y axis of each plot, something that distinguishes it from other things that you might want to plot on the y axis in some other plot you're showing. Then not only will HoloViews no longer link the axes inappropriately, the viewer of your plot will be able to tell that each plot is showing different things.\n    "}

I was trying to code it in Python with Levenstien's distance. I was having issues with short names of companies, and their trailing part like Pvt,Ltd. I have ran the same set with Excel Fuzzy lookup and was getting good results. I there a way that i can see how excel fuzzy lookup is coded and use the same implementation in python.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The following is an excerpt from Microsoft Fuzzy Lookup Add-In for Excel, Readme.docx. I hope that helps.\n\nAdvanced Concepts\nFuzzy Lookup technology is based upon a very simple, yet flexible\n  measure of similarity between two records. Jaccard similarity  Fuzzy\n  Lookup uses Jaccard similarity, which is defined as the size of the\n  set intersection divided by the size of the set union for two sets of\n  objects. For example, the sets {a, b, c} and {a, c, d} have a Jaccard\n  similarity of 2\/4 = 0.5 because the intersection is {a, c} and the\n  union is {a, b, c, d}. The more that the two sets have in common, the\n  closer the Jaccard similarity will be to 1.0. \nWeighted Jaccard similarity and tokenization of records  With Fuzzy\n  Lookup, you can assign weights to each item in a set and define the\n  weighted Jaccard similarity as the total weight of the intersection\n  divided by the total weight of the union. For the weighted sets {(a,\n  2), (b, 5), (c, 3)}, {(a, 2), (c, 3), (d, 7)}, the weighted Jaccard\n  similariyt is (2 + 3)\/(2 + 3 + 5 +7) = 5\/17 = .294. \nBecause Jaccard similarity is defined over sets, Fuzzy Lookup must\n  first convert data records to sets before it calculates the Jaccard\n  similarity. Fuzzy Lookup converts the data to sets using a Tokenizer.\n  For example, the record {“Jesper Aaberg”, “4567 Main Street”} might be\n  tokenized into the set, {“ Jesper”, “Aaberg”, “4567”, “Main”,\n  “Street”}. The default tokenizer is for English text, but one may\n  change the LocaleId property in Configure=>Global Settings to specify\n  tokenizers for other languages.\nToken weighting  Because not all tokens are of equal importance, Fuzzy\n  Lookup assigns weights to tokens. Tokens are assigned high weights if\n  they occur infrequently in a sample of records and low weights if they\n  occur frequently. For example, frequent words such as “Corporation”\n  might be given lower weight, while less frequent words such as\n  “Abracadabra” might be given a higher weight. One may override the\n  default token weights by supplying their own table of token weights.\nTransformations Transformations greatly increase the power of Jaccard\n  similarity by allowing tokens to be converted from one string to\n  another. For instance, one might know that the name “Bob” can be\n  converted to “Robert”; that “USA” is the same as “United States”; or\n  that “Missispi” is a misspelling of “Mississippi”. There are many\n  classes of such transformations that Fuzzy Lookup handles\n  automatically such as spelling mistakes (using Edit Transformations\n  described below), string prefixes, and string merge\/split operations.\n  You can also specify a table containing your own custom\n  transformations.\nJaccard similarity under transformations  The Jaccard similarity under\n  transformations is the maximum Jaccard similarity between any two\n  transformations of each set. Given a set of transformation rules, all\n  possible transformations of the set are considered. For example, for\n  the sets {a, b, c} and {a, c, d} and the transformation rules {b=>d,\n  d=>e}, the Jaccard similarity is computed as follows: Variations of\n  {a, b, c}: {a, b, c}, {a, d, c} Variations of {a, c, d}: {a, c, d},\n  {a, c, e} Maximum Jaccard similarity between all pairs: J({a, b, c},\n  {a, c, d}) = 2\/4 = 0.5 J({a, b, c}, {a, c, e}) = 2\/4 = 0.5 J({a, d,\n  c}, {a, c, d}) = 3\/3 = 1.0 J({a, d, c}, {a, c, e}) = 2\/4 = 0.5 The\n  maximum is 1.0. Note: Weghted Jaccard similiary under transformations\n  is simply the maximum weighted Jaccard similarity across all pairs of\n  transformed sets. \nEdit distance  Edit distance is the total number of character\n  insertions, deletions, or substitutions that it takes to convert one\n  string to another.

When used from the Ipython console, works as expected. However, when used from the editor (which is my main way of writing), is erratic. The autocompletion works (i.e. when pressing TAB a little box appears showing options) for some modules, such as pandas or matplotlib. So writing 'pd.' and hitting TAB, gets the box with options as expected. However, this does not happen with many other objects: for example, after defining a dataframe named 'df', typing 'df.' TAB shows nothing. In the Ipython console, 'df.' TAB would show the available procedures for that dataframe, such as groupby, and also its columns, etc..\nSo the question is threefold. First, is there any particular configuration that should be enabled to get this to work? I don't think so, given some time spent googling, but just wanna make sure. Second, could someone state what is the official word on what works and what doesn't in terms of autocompletion (e.g. what particular modules do work from the editor, and which ones doesn't?). Finally, what are the technical aspects of the differences between the editor and the Ipython console in the performance of the autocompletion with Spyder? I read something about Jedi vs. PsychoPy modules, so got curious (however, please keep in mind that although I have scientific experience, I am relatively new to computation, so please keep it reasonably simple for an educated but not expert person).\nUPDATE: As a side question, it would be great to know why is the autocompletion better in Rodeo (another IDE).

I have a dataset of 300k documents with an average of 560 words (no stop word removal yet) 75% in German, 15% in English and the rest in different languages. The goal is to recommend similar documents based on an existing one. At the beginning I want to focus on the German and English documents.  \nTo achieve this goal I looked into several methods on feature extraction for document similarity, especially the word embedding methods have impressed me because they are context aware in contrast to simple TF-IDF feature extraction and the calculation of cosine similarity. \nI'm overwhelmed by the amount of methods I could use and I haven't found a proper evaluation of those methods yet. I know for sure that the size of my documents are too big for BERT, but there is FastText, Sent2Vec, Doc2Vec and the Universal Sentence Encoder from Google. My favorite method based on my research is Doc2Vec even though there aren't any or old pre-trained models which means I have to do the training on my own.\nNow that you know my task and goal, I have the following questions:\n\nWhich method should I use for feature extraction based on the rough overview of my data?\nMy dataset is too small to train Doc2Vec on it. Do I achieve good results if I train the model on English \/ German Wikipedia?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You really have to try the different methods on your data, with your specific user tasks, with your time\/resources budget to know which makes sense.\nYou 225K German documents and 45k English documents are each plausibly large enough to use Doc2Vec - as they match or exceed some published results. So you wouldn't necessarily need to add training on something else (like Wikipedia) instead, and whether adding that to your data would help or hurt is another thing you'd need to determine experimentally.\n(There might be special challenges in German given compound words using common-enough roots but being individually rare, I'm not sure. FastText-based approaches that use word-fragments might be helpful, but I don't know a Doc2Vec-like algorithm that necessarily uses that same char-ngrams trick. The closest that might be possible is to use Facebook FastText's supervised mode, with a rich set of meaningful known-labels to bootstrap better text vectors - but that's highly speculative and that mode isn't supported in Gensim.)\n    "}

Along with it I receive timestamps of a periodic event in this data in the format of %Y-%m-d %H:%M:%S.%f, which looks e.g. like this 2019-05-23 17:50:34.346000.\nI now created a method to calculate these periodic events myself and was wondering how I could evalute my methods accuracy. My calculations are sometimes bigger and sometimes smaller by a few milliseconds compared to the actual timestamp. But when I run my own calculated timestamp against the actual timestamp by using pythons scipy.stats.pearsonr(x,y) method, I always receive a correlation of nearly 1. I assume that‘s because these small differences in the order of millisenconds don‘t seem relevant in an hour of data. But how could I evaluate the accuracy of two timestamps a reasonable way? Are there better metrics to use than the correlation?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It seems that you are trying to compute a linear statistical correlation (pearson) for something that is, by nature, a timeseries data. This will not tell you much and drawing a conclusion based on the results is dangerous.\nIt so happens that your two vectors x and y are growing linearly in the same direction which is not surprising given that they are timestamps.\nLet's take an example for stationary data and time series data:\nTime series data:\nYour sensor starts giving measurements at time t1 and continues to do so until time t2 is reached. You compute the periodic event's timestamp using your own method then compare it to the actual timestamp. However, there is no reliable way using linear statistical correlations to see if the two are related and how related are they.\nStationary data :\nNow consider the same sensor giving measurements, but now instead of computing your periodic events all at once, take a single event and compute it multiple times using your empirical data using different measurements (so forget about any notion of time at this point (i.e. repeat the measurement multiple times). The result can be averaged and an error on the mean can be computed (see info on standard error). This, now, can be compared to your single event. Based on the error, you can get a more or less feel of how good or bad your method is.\nI would recommend the following :\n\nYou have your ground truth answer (say, the periodic event) y_truth. You compute a vector of the periodic events based on your sensor and your own method mapped as a function  f(sensor_input) = y_measured\n\nNow you have two vectors, one measured and one that is ground truth. In each of those vectors, you have an indicator of a the periodic events such as an  id. I would repeat the whole set of measurements, on all  id's tens of times.\n\nFor each 'id' I would compute whatever measurement you are looking for (either a timestamp or time in seconds or whatever...) then I would subtract the two timestamps :  |y_truth - y_measured|. This is called residuals or in other words, your error.\n\nNow averging all the residuals of all the id's gives you something called mean absolute error (1\/n * sum (|y_truth - y_measured|) which you can very confidently use to report how much error, in a unit of time (seconds for example), your method produces.\n    "}

However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.\nOne day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about \"big data\" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.\nMy first thought is to use HDFStore to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:\nWhat are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:\n\nLoading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure\nQuerying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure\nUpdating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas\n\nReal-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on \"large data\".\nEdit -- an example of how I would like this to work:\n\nIteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.\nIn order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.\nI would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.\nI would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.\n\nI am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.\nEdit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:\n\nI am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.\nTypical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, if var1 > 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.\nFinally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.\nA typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.\nIt's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.\nThe modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.\n\nIt is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics\/machine learning parlance).\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One more variation\nMany of the operations done in pandas can also be done as a db query (sql, mongo)\nUsing a RDBMS or mongodb allows you to perform some of the aggregations in the DB Query (which is optimized for large data, and uses cache and indexes efficiently)\nLater, you can perform post processing using pandas.\nThe advantage of this method is that you gain the DB optimizations for working with large data, while still defining the logic in a high level declarative syntax - and not having to deal with the details of deciding what to do in memory and what to do out of core.\nAnd although the query language and pandas are different, it's usually not complicated to translate part of the logic from one to another.\n    "}

Splitting all the features into one hot encoded features (if A is say a categorical features that takes values 'a', 'b' and 'c', then it becomes A_a, A_b and A_c with binary values in each of its rows with binary value '1' meaning that the observation has the feature and binary value '0' meaning it does not possess the feature!). I would then fit a DecisionTreeClassifier on this.\nb. Not splitting all the features, but converting each category into an integer value WITHOUT performing one hot encoding (if A is say a categorical features that takes values 'a', 'b' and 'c', then 'a', 'b' and 'c' are renamed as 1, 2, 3 and no new columns are created, 'A' remains a single column with integer values 1, 2, 3 by using pandas.factorize or something which you an then fit a DecisionTreeClassifier.\nMy question is, when you fit DecisionTreeClassifier on the one hot encoded dataset, with multiple columns, will each of the new columns be treated as a separate feature?\nAlso, if you fit the DecisionTreeClassifier on the dataset where the categorical features are simply converted to an integer and kept in a single column; will it produce the same node splits, as the one where the DecisionTreeClassifier was fit on the dataset with the one-hot encoded features?\nLike, when you visualize the tree in both cases, \nis the interpretation given below the right way to look at it?\nfor DecisionTreeClassifier with one-hot-encoding\nif attribute == A_a, then yes\nif attribute == A_b, then no\nfor DecisionTreeClassifier without one-hot-encoding ('a' represented by integer value 1 and 'b' by value 2)\nif attribute == 1 then yes\nif attribute == 2, then no\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The two options you are describing do two very different things. \nIf you choose to binarize (one-hot encode) the values of the variable, there is no order to them. The decision tree at each split, considers a binary split on each of the new binary variables and chooses the most informative one. So yes, each binary feature is now treated as an independent feature.\nThe second choice puts the values in an order. Implicitly you are saying that a < b < c if transforming a=1, b=2, c=3. If you use this variable in a decision tree, the algorithm considers the splits 1 vs 2,3 and 1,2 vs 3 (but not 3 vs 1,2). \nSo the meaning of the variables is very different and I don't think you can expect equivalent results.\n    "}

A depth-first search solution with recursion would be:\n\nCreate a map counters to store a counter for each level. E.g. counters[i] is the number of nodes found so far at level i. Let's say level 0 is the root.\nDefine a recursive function count_subtree(node, level): Increment counters[level] once. Then for each child of the given node, call count_subtree(child, level + 1) (the child is at a 1-deeper level).\nCall count_subtree(root_node, 0) to count starting at the root. This will result in count_subtree being run exactly once on each node because each node only has one parent, so counters[level] will be incremented once per node. A leaf node is the base case (no children to call the recursive function on).\nBuild your final list from the values of counters, ordered by their keys ascending.\n\nThis would work with any kind of tree, not just binary. Running time is O(number of nodes in tree).

How do I tell if my good results are actually good results or whether they are overfitting?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Overfitting is generally associated with high variance, meaning that the model parameters that would result from being fitted to some realized data set have a high variance from data set to data set. You collected some data, fit some model, got some parameters ... you do it again and get new data and now your parameters are totally different.\nOne consequence of this is that in the presence of overfitting, usually the training error (the error from re-running the model directly on the data used to train it) will be very low, or at least low in contrast to the test error (running the model on some previously unused test data).\nOne diagnostic that is suggested by Andrew Ng is to separate some of your data into a testing set. Ideally this should have been done from the very beginning, so that happening to see the model fit results inclusive of this data would never have the chance to impact your decision. But you can also do it after the fact as long as you explain so in your model discussion.\nWith the test data, you want to compute the same error or loss score that you compute on the training data. If training error is very low, but testing error is unacceptably high, you probably have overfitting.\nFurther, you can vary the size of your test data and generate a diagnostic graph. Let's say that you randomly sample 5% of your data, then 10%, then 15% ... on up to 30%. This will give you six different data points showing the resulting training error and testing error.\nAs you increase the training set size (decrease testing set size), the shape of the two curves can give some insight.\nThe test error will be decreasing and the training error will be increasing. The two curves should flatten out and converge with some gap between them.\nIf that gap is large, you are likely dealing with overfitting, and it suggests to use a large training set and to try to collect more data if possible.\nIf the gap is small, or if the training error itself is already too large, it suggests model bias is the problem, and you should consider a different model class all together.\nNote that in the above setting, you can also substitute a k-fold cross validation for the test set approach. Then, to generate a similar diagnostic curve, you should vary the number of folds (hence varying the size of the test sets). For a given value of k, then for each subset used for testing, the other (k-1) subsets are used for training error, and averaged over each way of assigning the folds. This gives you both a training error and testing error metric for a given choice of k. As k becomes larger, the training set sizes becomes bigger (for example, if k=10, then training errors are reported on 90% of the data) so again you can see how the scores vary as a function of training set size.\nThe downside is that CV scores are already expensive to compute, and repeated CV for many different values of k makes it even worse.\nOne other cause of overfitting can be too large of a feature space. In that case, you can try to look at importance scores of each of your features. If you prune out some of the least important features and then re-do the above overfitting diagnostic and observe improvement, it's also some evidence that the problem is overfitting and you may want to use a simpler set of features or a different model class.\nOn the other hand, if you still have high bias, it suggests the opposite: your model doesn't have enough feature space to adequately account for the variability of the data, so instead you may want to augment the model with even more features.\n    "}

But, while not revolutionary, Pandas does have key benefits. \nFor a while I had also perceived Pandas as just utilities on top of NumPy for those who liked the DataFrame interface.  However, I now see Pandas as providing these key features (this is not comprehensive):\n\nArray of Structures (independent-storage of disparate types instead of the contiguous storage of structured arrays in NumPy) --- this will allow faster processing in many cases.\nSimpler interfaces to common operations (file-loading, plotting, selection, and joining \/ aligning data) make it easy to do a lot of work in little code.\nIndex arrays which mean that operations are always aligned instead of having to keep track of alignment yourself. \nSplit-Apply-Combine is a powerful way of thinking about and implementing data-processing\n\nHowever, there are downsides to Pandas: \n\nPandas is basically a user-interface library and not particularly suited for writing library code.   The \"automatic\" features can lull you into repeatedly using them even when you don't need to and slowing down code that gets called over and over again.   \nPandas typically takes up more memory as it is generous with the creation of object arrays to solve otherwise sticky problems of things like string handling. \nIf your use-case is outside the realm of what Pandas was designed to do, it gets clunky quickly.   But, within the realms of what it was designed to do, Pandas is powerful and easy to use for quick data analysis.\n    "}

The solution is, given an image, you need to use a sliding window to crop different part of the image, then use a classifier to decide if there are texts in the cropped area. If so, use your character\/digit recognizer to tell which characters\/digits they really are.\nSo you need to train another classifer: given a cropped image (the size of cropped images should be slightly larger than that of your text area), decide if there are texts inside.\nJust construct training set (positive samples are text areas, negative samples are other areas randomly cropped from the big images) and train it~\n    "}

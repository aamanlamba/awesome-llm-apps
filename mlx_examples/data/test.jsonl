In this case, it is due to the fact that your model is not certain when it makes a prediction (at least at this stage of training).\nImagine that you have a binary classification model(between apples and oranges). At each prediction, when the ground truth is an apple, the network is 51% confident that the image is of an apple. We have the ground_truth apple, and as Keras does behind the curtains, the default confidence threshold is 50%. Then all the predictions are good and you have a good accuracy.\nHowever, now comes the 'problematic' epoch. Due to the changed values of the weights of your neural network after another epoch of training, when you predict on your validation dataset, you get a confidence of 48-49% for each ground_truth apple, and again, since the threshold is 50%, you get much poorer accuracy than the previous epoch.\nThis particular case that you are experiencing, as you can now infer from the previous explanation, does not affect the loss so much, but the accuracy. It does not affect the loss that much during backpropagation, because a difference in the confidence prediction between 49% and 51% when computing the loss is not a very significant difference in the overall loss(as you see in your case, only a 0.26%). In the end, even at the 'previous epoch', when the model predicted correctly an apple, the neural network was not that extremely confident, by yielding only 51% confidence for an apple, not 95% for instance.\n    "}

With a little cleverness the above processing can all be done in parallel, hogging a lot of CPU time. To do this in parallel, each conformance algorithm forms part of a large OS-level pipeline. The source file must be reformatted to leave empty columns for each dimension's FK reference. Each conformance process reads in the source file and writes out the same format file with one dimension FK filled in. If all of these conformance algorithms form a simple OS pipe, they all run in parallel. It looks something like this.\nsrc2cvs source | conform1 | conform2 | conform3 | load\nAt the end, you use the RDBMS's bulk loader (or write your own in Python, it's easy) to pick the actual fact values and the dimension FK's out of the source records that are fully populated with all dimension FK's and load these into the fact table.\n    "}

Sparse matrices are an option (as larsmans mentioned in the comments, both scipy and pandas have sparse matrix implementations), but these will only help if the fraction of zero-value entries is large.

Right now I am using sklearn and TensorFlow. I was wondering what to do if I have a model that needs updating when new data comes. For example, I have financial data. I built an LSTM model with TensorFlow and trained it. But new data comes in every day, and I don't want to retrain the model every day. Is there a way just to update the model and not retrain it from scratch?\nIn sklearn, the documentation for .fit() method (using DecisionTreeClassifier as an example) says that it\n\nBuild a decision tree classifier from the training set (X, y).\n\nSo it seems like it will retrain the entire model from scratch.\nIn tensorflow, .fit() method (using Sequential as an example) say\n\nTrains the model for a fixed number of epochs (iterations on a\ndataset).\n\nSo it seems like it does update the model instead of retraining. But I am not sure if my understanding is correct. I would be grateful for some clarification.

So assuming you have new data coming in every day you will have to retrain each time in the case of most sklearn algorithms.\nAlthough, If you like to retrain the sklearn models instead of training from scratch, some algorithms of sklearn (like SGDClassifier) provide a method called partial_fit(). These can be used to retrain and update the weights of an existing model.\nAs per Tensorflow, the .fit() method actually trains the model without discarding any info pertaining to previous trainings. Hence each time .fit() is used via TF it will actually retrain the model.\nTip: you can use SaveModel from TF to save the best model and reload and re-train the model as and when more data keeps flowing in.\n    "}

However, if you're instead saving the model state for future use only for inference, you don't need the optimizer state for anything.

The photos themselves confirmed that they both sets of observations were from Central Park, but the lat\/longs were in fact further apart than epsilon.\nAfter a little investigation, I discovered that the reason for this was because the lat\/long geotags (which were generated from the phone's GPS) are pretty imprecise.

If median value for the non zero actor_pay column is budget\/actor_pay=60% then filling the actor_pay column of a zeroed value with 60 percent of the budget for that movie would be an option.\nHard option create a function that takes the non zero values of a movies budgets and attempts to interpolate the movies budget based upon the other movies data in the table.

Writing a float to text takes ~9 bytes of text (estimating 1 for integer, 1 for decimal, 5 for mantissa and 2 for separator), which comes out to 40GiB. This takes a long time to do, since just the conversion to text itself is non-trivial, and disk I\/O will be a huge bottle-neck.\nOne way to optimize this process may be to convert the entire array to text on your own terms, and write it in blocks using Python's binary I\/O. I doubt that will give you too much benefit though.\nA much better solution would be to write the binary data to a file instead of text. Aside from the obvious advantages of space and speed, binary has the advantage of being searchable and not requiring transformation after loading. You know where every individual element is in the file, if you are clever, you can access portions of the file without loading the entire thing. Finally, a binary file is more likely to be highly compressible than a relatively low-entropy text file.\nDisadvantages of binary are that it is not human-readable, and not as portable as text. The latter is not a problem, since transforming into an acceptable format will be trivial. The former is likely a non-issue given the amount of data you are attempting to process anyway.\nKeep in mind that human readability is a relative term. A human can not read 40iGB of numerical data with understanding. A human can process A) a graphical representation of the data, or B) scan through relatively small portions of the data. Both cases are suitable for binary representations. Case A) is straightforward: load, transform and plot the data. This will be much faster if the data is already in a binary format that you can pass directly to the analysis and plotting routines. Case B) can be handled with something like a memory mapped file. You only ever need to load a small portion of the file, since you can't really show more than say a thousand elements on screen at one time anyway. Any reasonable modern platform should be able to keep upI\/O and binary-to-text conversion associated  with a user scrolling around a table widget or similar. In fact, binary makes it easier since you know exactly where each element belongs in the file.\n    "}

Herein the pixel classification is binary ( 0 = non-road, 1 = road). Hence, the mask of the complete satellite image which is 6400 x 6400 pixels shows one large road network where each road is connected to another road. For the implementation of the U-net I divided that large image in 625 images of 256 x 256 pixels. \nMy question is: Can a neural network easier find structure with an increase in batch size (thus can it find structure between different batches), or can it only find structure if the input image size is enlarged?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If your model is a regular convolutional network (without any weird hacks), the samples in a batch will not be connected to each other. \nDepending on which loss function you use, the batch size might be important too. For regular functions (available 'mse', 'binary_crossentropy', 'categorical_crossentropy', etc.), they all keep the samples independent from each other. But some losses might consider the entire batch. (F1 metrics, for instance). If you're using a loss function that doesn't treat samples independently, then the batch size is very important.\nThat said, having a bigger batch size may help the net to find its way more easily, since one image might push weights towards one direction, while another may want a different direction. The mean results of all images in the batch should then be more representative of a general weight update.\nNow, entering an experimenting field (we never know everything about neural networks until we test them), consider this comparison:\n\na batch with 1 huge image versus   \na batch of patches of the same image\n\nBoth will have the same amount of data, and for a convolutional network, it wouldn't make a drastic difference. But for the first case, the net will probably be better at finding connections between roads, maybe find more segments where the road might be covered by something, while the small patches, being full of borders might be looking more into textures and be not good at identifying these gaps.\nAll of this is, of course, a guess. Testing is the best.\nMy net in a GPU cannot really use big patches, which is bad for me...\n    "}

If the tabular dataset doesn't include those empty parquet files, TabularDataset.to_pandas_dataframe() completes within few minutes.\nBy empty parquet file, I mean that the if I read the individual parquet file using pandas (pd.read_parquet()), it results in an empty DF (df.empty == True).\nI discovered the root cause while working on another issue mentioned [here][1].\nMy question is how can make TabularDataset.to_pandas_dataframe() work even when there are empty parquet files?\nUpdate\nThe issue has been fixed in the following version:\n\nazureml-dataprep : 3.0.1\nazureml-core :  1.40.0\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Thanks for reporting it.\nThis is a bug in handling of the parquet files with columns but empty row set.

At first, I just worked with authors that had at least 30 books. In my dataset, that was ~2000 books written by ~30 authors in total, and that went pretty great, so I decided to raise the stakes. By lowering the threshold to 10 books, the database grew to ~400 authors and ~9000 books.\nThe way I classified the books is as follows: I removed punctuation, newlines, extra spaces, and stopwords from every text, then I extracted the features with sklearn CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. With this approach, the F1 score was 0.95 for the 2000 books db and 0.62 for the 9000 books db. In both cases I used the SGD model from scikit learn.\nThe training with the larger dataset was much slower, so I decided to get 5000 random words from each book and use only those. This decreased the training time from 20 minutes to only 2 minutes, and enabled me to try something different. There wasn't a big difference in the various metrics, so I decided to try and remove the tfidf features. Using only CountVectorizer I got a 0.87 F1 score.\nI'm not sure why this is happening, my expectation was that the tfidf would make things easier and therefore better my score. In theory, tfidf should help with the sparsity of the matrix. Do you have any clue on why removing it improved the score instead?\nAre there other strategies, maybe better suited to work with long texts? Should I consider trimming the dataset in a certain way?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There might be 2 problems here:\n\nYou have not tuned the parameters for TFIDF and hence it is giving low scores. Try to do a grid search and parameters such as min_df, max_df, max_features etc. This might increase the scores. CountVectorizer might be preforming good because the classifier might be associating some unique words with a certain author. \nThe data imbalance problem. You can try to use SMOTE on the TFIDF features, or if you are using Logistic Regression you can set class_weights='balanced' and that might also increase scores.\n    "}

I would appreciate it if one clarifies it for me.\nSuppose I have a set of tweets which labeled as negative and positive. I want to perform some sentiment analysis. \nI extracted 3 basic features: \n\nEmotion icons \nExclamation marks \nIntensity words(very, really etc.). \n\nHow should I use these features with SVM or other ML algorithms? \nIn other words, how should I deploy the extracted features in SVM algorithm?\nI'm working with python and already know how should I run SVM or other algorithms, but I don't have any idea about the relation between extracted features and role of them in each algorithm!\nBased on the responses of some experts I update my question:\nAt first, I wanna appreciate your time and worthy explanations. I think my problem is solving… So in line with what you said, each ML algorithm may need some vectorized features and I should find a way to represent my features as vectors. I want to explain what I got from your explanation via a rudimentary example.\nSay I have emoticon icons (for example 3 icons) as one feature:\n1-Hence, I should represent this feature by a vector with 3 values. \n2-The vectorized feature can initial in this way : [0,0,0] (each value represents an icon = :) and :( and :P ). \n3-Next I should go through each tweet and check whether the tweet has an icon or not. For example [2,1,0] shows that the tweet has: :) 2 times, and :( 1 time, and :p no time.\n4-After I check all the tweets I will have a big vector with the size of n*3 (n is the total number of my tweets). \n5-Stages 1-4 should be done for other features.\n6-Then I should merge all those features by using m models of SVM (m is the number of my features) and then classify by majority vote or some other method.\nOr should create a long vector by concatenating all of the vectors, and feed it to the SVM.\nCould you please correct me if there is any misunderstanding? If it is not correct I will delete it otherwise I should let it stay cause It can be practical for any beginners such as me...\nThanks a bunch…\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>basically, to make things very \"simple\" and \"shallow\", all algorithm takes some sort of a numeric vector represent the features\nthe real work is to find how to represent the features as vector which yield the best result, this depends by the feature itself and on the algorithm using\nfor example to use SVM which basically find a separator plane, you need to project the features on some vectors set which yield a good enough separation, so for instance you can treat your features like this:\n\nEmotion icons - create a vector which represent all the icons present in that tweet, define each icon to an index from 1 to n so tweet represented by [0,0,0,2,1] means the 4th and 5th icons are appearing in his body 2 and 1 times respectively\nExclamation marks - you can simply count the number of occurrences (a better approach will be to represent some more information about it like the place in a sentence and such...)\nIntensity words - you can use the same approach as the Emotion icons\n\nbasically each feature can be used alone in the SVM model to classify good and bad\nyou can merge all those features by using 3 models of SVM and then classify by majority vote or some other method\nor\nyou can create a long vector by concatenating all of the vectors, and feed it to the SVM\n\nthis is just a one approach, you might tweak it or use some other one to fit your data, model and goal better\n    "}

When I train my model for only 10 epochs, I get a validation accuracy of 25%, where everything is being labeled as the white mug. However when I would train the same model for longer, it eventually diverts from this 25% accuracy and climbs up to 80%, the only problem it has, is classifying the white mug.\nIn other words, if I am able to find why my classifier classifies the white mug wrongly, then I could potentially reach validation_accuracy of 90%. My question thus is, what are some things I could try to find out why it mispredicts, or things to improve. I have already used LIME to check why my model classifies something, but I could not get any wiser from it.\nSome specs of the model:\n\nNo data augmentation\n5 convolutional layers (32, 64, 128, 256, 512) -> into GlobalMaxPooling, Flatten, and 2 dense layers (128, 4)\nActivation layers (relu)\n2000 training images, 1000 validation images (classes are balanced)\n\nExtra: The model gets 100% accuracy on the training data after 2 epochs, and slowly climbs up to 80% on the validation data (after about 40-50 epochs).\nExtra 2: Sometimes the model gets 80%, sometimes only 74%\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The model is reaching 100% training accuracy when validation accuracy is still only 25%.

Data augmentation would likely significantly reduce overfitting and improve validation accuracy - I would start with random cropping, brightness, and saturation. Collecting more training data with varied backgrounds, orientations, and lighting conditions would also help.\n    "}

Also the replay buffer has the same constraint only handling batch size number of experiences.\nI wanted to use checkpointer and save all the predictions (experience from driver which are saved in replay buffer) from the past 4 days and train only on the first of the 4 days saved on each given day.\nI am unsure how to do the following and any help is greatly appreciate.\n\nHow to (run the driver) save replay buffer using checkpoints for the entire day (a day contains, say, 3 predictions runs and each prediction will be made on 30,000 observations [say batch size of 16]).

Seems to me like the most straight forward solution for this is to take the memory inefficiency hit and have two RB with a different size of max_length. One of the two is the one given to the driver to store episodes and then rb.as_dataset(single_determinsitic_pass=true) is used to get the appropriate items to place in the memory of the second one used for training. The only thing you need to checkpoint of course is the first one.\nNote: I'm not sure off-the-top-of-my head how exactly single_determinsitic_pass works, you may want to check that in order to determine which portion of the returned dataset corresponds to the day you want to train from. I also have the suspicion that probably the portion corresponding to the last day shifts, because if I don't remember wrong the RB table that stores the experiences works with a cursor that once reached the maximum length starts overwriting from the beginning.\nNeither RB needs to know about the logic of how many prediction runs there are, in the end your code should manage that logic and you might want to keep track (maybe in a pickle if you want to save this) how many predictions correspond to each day so that you know which ones to pick.\n    "}

Keras starts with random weights for neurons and goes one by one 100 times using provided samples to adjust network weights. Keras actually uses batches which means 100 samples are divided into smaller groups for better learning rate and general performance (less data to store in memory at once).\n10 neurons are 10 'places' where network is able to store multiplications results between neuron weights and input data. You could imagine neuron as a bulb which lights a bit brighter or darker depending whether data shows some useful data feature eg. if animal is above 3 meters tall. Each neuron has its own set of weights which are changed just a bit when network examines next sample from your data. At the end you should have 10 neurons (bulbs) which react in more or less intense way depending on presence of different features in your data eg. if animal is very tall. \nThe more neurons you have the more possible features you can track eg. if animal is tall, hairy, orange, spotted etc. But the more neurons you have there is also the higher risk that your network will be too exact and will learn features which are unique for your training example (it's called overfitting) but do not help you to recognize animal samples which were not included in your training data (it's called ability to generalize and is most important point of actually training neural network). Selecting number of neurons is then a bit of practical exercise where you search for one which works for your need.\nI hope it clarifies your doubts. If you would like to get deeper in this field there are a lot of good resources online explaining neural networks training process in details including features, neurons and learning.\n    "}

I am asking for a suitable interprocess communication data-structure for my specific scenario:\nMy scenario\nI have one producer and one consumer.\n\nThe producer produces a single fairly small panda Dataframe every 10-ish secs, then the producer puts it on a python.multiprocess.queue.\nThe consumer is a GUI polling that python.multiprocess.queue every 100ms. It is VERY CRITICAL that the consumer catches every single DataFrame the producer produces.\n\nMy thinking\npython.multiprocess.queue is serving the purpose (I think), and amazingly simple to use! (praise the green slithereen lord!). But I am clearly not utilizing queue's full potential with only one producer one consumer and a max of one item on the queue. That leads me to believe that there is simpler thing than queue. I tried to search for it, I got overwhelmed by options listed in: python 3.5 documentation: 18. Interprocess Communication and Networking. I am also suspecting there may be a way not involving interprocess communication data-structure at all for my need.\nPlease Note\n\nPerformance is not very important\nI will stick with multiprocessing for now, instead of multithreading.\n\nMy Question\nShould I be content with queue? or is there a more recommended way? I am not a professional programmer, so I insist on doing things the tried and tested way.\nI also welcome any suggestions of alternative ways of approaching my problem.\nThanks\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>To me, the most important thing you mentioned is this:\n\nIt is VERY CRITICAL that the consumer catches every single DataFrame the producer produces.\n\nSo, let's suppose you used a variable to store the DataFrame. The producer would set it to the produced value, and the consumer would just read it. That would work very fine, I guess.\nBut what would happen if somehow the consumer got blocked by more than one producing cycle? Then some old value would be overwritten before reading. And that's why I think a (thread-safe) queue is the way to go almost \"by definition\".\nBesides, beware of premature optimization. If it works for your case, excellent. If some day, for some other case, performance comes to be a problem, only then you should spend the extra work, IMO.\n    "}

In my implementation cv is an int, so I'm applying the K-fold validation method. Looking at cv_results_['mean_test_score'],\n the best mean score on the k-fold unseen data is around 0.7, while the train scores are much higher, like 0.999. This is very normal, and I'm ok with that.\nWell, following the reasoning behind this concept, when I apply the best_estimator_ on the whole data set, I expect to see at least some part of the data predicted not perfectly, right? Instead, the numerical deviations between the predicted quantities and the real values are near zero for all datapoints. And this smells of overfitting.\nI don't understand that, because if I remove a small part of the data and apply GridSearchCV to the remaining part, I find almost identical results as above, but the best regressor applied to the totally unseen data predicts with much higher errors, like 10%, 30% or 50%. Which is what I expected, at least for some points, fitting GridSearchCV on the whole set, based on the results of k-fold test sets.\nNow, I understand that this forces the predictor to see all datapoints, but the best estimator is the result of k fits, each of them never saw 1\/k fraction of data. Being the mean_test_score the average between these k scores, I expect to see a bunch of predictions (depending on cv value) which show errors distributed around a mean error that justifies a 0.7 score.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The refit=True parameter of GridSearchCV makes the estimator with the found best set of hyperparameters be refit on the full data.

Now when you use an error function, estimator with higher score will be ranked higher by sklearn, which is not true in the case of MAE (along with MSE and a few others).\nTo deal with this, the library flips the sign of error, so the highest MAE will be ranked lowest and vice versa.\nSo to answer your question: -2.6 is better than -3.0 because the actual MAE is 2.6 and 3.0 respectively.\n    "}

To develop the code I used a small sample image, and after some work the code was working brilliantly.  However, when I normalize the histogram first, generating bin values <<1, or when I histogram huge images, generating bin values in the hundreds of thousands, fmin_slsqp() starts failing sporadically.  It quits after only ~5 iterations, usually just returning a slightly modified version of the initial guess I gave it, and returns exit mode 8, which means \"Positive directional derivative for linesearch.\"  If I check the size of the bin counts at the beginning and scale them into the neighborhood of ~100-1000, fmin_slsqp() works as usual. I just un-scale things before returning the results. I guess I could leave it like that, but it feels like a hack.\nI have looked around and found folks talking about the epsilon value, which is basically the dx used for approximating derivatives, but tweaking that has not helped.

FuncAnimation in the other hand seems to be more useful whenever you have a function that is able to give it your next result. \nIs my intuition above correct about this? My question in general is when is more convenient to use one or the other.\nThanks in advance\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I think you are right, although it is simple to go from a list to a function (just iterate over it) or back (store function values in an array).\nSo it really doesn't matter too much, but you can pick the one that best suits your code, as you described.\n(Personally I find ArtistAnimation to be the most convenient)\nIf your result is very large, it might be good to use FuncAnimation so you don't need to store your data. MPL still stores it's own copy for plotting, but this factor two might make a difference.\n    "}

The following operation can be made on the graph:\nA set of edges represented by two vertex pairs (i, j) and (x, y) can be switched into (i, y) and (x, j)\nThe following are the tasks that need to be accomplished:\n\nDetermine if it is possible to connect the graph.\nIf yes, find the minimum number of operations to connect the graph.\nOutput the edges used per operation in the following order: i j x y\n\nAn additional constraint is that a vertex cannot be connected to itself. Vertices can be up to n = 10^5\nI have already implemented the switch function defined above, however, my current solution is very inefficient and may not be applicable to all possible inputs. It basically checks for any four vertices with multiple connections and applies the switch operation, then runs a DFS (depth-first search) algorithm to check if the graph is connected or not, so it runs a DFS every time it makes an operation. Additionally, this doesn't deal with the minimum operations, it just does operations until the graph becomes connected. Are there any implementation tips or algorithms that can help in solving the problem, preferably in Python?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Say your graph G has n vertices, e edges, and k > 1 components.\nA solution is possible iff there are no isolated vertices and e >= n-1. It will take k-1 switches.\nIf e < n-1 then there aren't enough edges for a connected graph to exist. If there's an isolated vertex, switch operations can't affect it so it will remain isolated.\nOtherwise, repeatedly perform the following switch: One edge should belong to a component where its removal won't disconnect the component. This is guaranteed to exist if there are multiple components and e >= n-1. The other edge can belong to any other component (and it doesn't matter if its removal would disconnect the component). Performing the switch operation will merge these components, reducing the total number of components by one.\nWe perform k-1 switches, reducing the number of components from k to 1, at which point the graph is connected.\n--- O(V+E) approach ---\n\nConfirm there are no isolated vertices and that E >= V-1.\nUse BFS to split the input graph G into its components. While doing this, keep track of every edge that completes a cycle (connects to an already visited vertex). Call these 'swappable edges'\nRepeatedly perform swap operations where one edge is swappable, and the other is an arbitrary edge of some other component.\nNote that if the other edge is also swappable, then both new edges after the swap are on a cycle. Choose one of them (arbitrarily) to add to the list of swappable edges.\nEach swap reduces the number of swappable edges by one and the number of components by one. Keep going until you're down to one component.\n    "}

Often times, the predicted value is a line of best fit.\ny_true are the raw numbers you collect during either an experiment, survey, or scientific study.\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that you have a model of a teenagers height as a function of age.\n\n\n\n\nAGE (years since birth)\n10 years\n12 years\n14 years\n16 years\n\n\n\n\nHIEGHT (inches)\n55\n60\n65\n68\n\n\n\n\nAGE is defined as years since birth (not years since conception, like in China).\nAlso, we round age down to the nearest whole year.\nA child 10.81773 years old is listed as 10 years old.\nAn example of a predicted value might be that you think, on average, a child 10 years of age is 55 inches tall.\nIf you conduct a study where you measure the height of 1,038 children who are each 10 years old, you will find that the children are not all exactly 55 inches tall.\nThe raw data (measured heights of children) is known as the set of true y-values.\nStatisticians often measure error by comparing the distance from the measured height of a child from the predicted height.\nFor example, 10-year-old Joanna's height is 52 inches (rounded to the nearest whole inch).\nWe predicted Joanna's height to be 55 inches.\nThere are 3 inches of difference between the true, and the predicted, values.\nOften times, statisticians want one number for a data set, instead of 1,038 different numbers.\nOne thing you can do is convert the difference between the predicted height, and the actual heights of the children, into a positive number. For example, -5 becomes +5\nAfter that, compute the average positive-difference (in inches) between actual height and predicted height.\nTaking the absolute difference is important. Some children are shorter than predicted (-2 inches), and some children are taller (+7 inches).\nIf you allow negative numbers the average difference between the average height and actual height will always be zero.\n\nTake 1,038 actual heights.\nsubtract 55 inches from the actual height.\nsum up the height discrepancies without converting to positive numbers\nthe result will always be zero.\n\nIn fact, one way to define mean is that the mean of a sequence of numbers is a number x such that when you calculate the difference between each data-point and x, then sum the results, the answer is zero.\nGenerally, statisticians square the differences.\nSince Joanna was short  (-2 inches) the squared error for Joanna is +4 inches.\nA negative number times a negative number is always a positive number.\nSquaring gets rid of the negative signs.\nTaking the absolute value gets rid of the negative signs.\nActually... there are about a million ways to get rid of the negative signs.\nSome statistician's are like the parrots in the 1998 movie \"Paulie.\"\nI say \"taco\" and they say \"TACO! TACO! TACO!\"\nThey copy what other statisticians do, and it never occurs to them that there is more than one way to do statistical analysis.\nI have a degree in math, I have seen proofs that the curve which minimizes the mean-squared-error is ideal in some ways.\nHowever, the mean-squared-error is more of a heuristic, or proxy, than a measure of what really, truly, matters.\nNobody actually has a formula which perfectly computes for data-set A, and data-set B, which data-set is more \"spread-out\" than the other.\nIt is difficult to tell what humans care about.\nAnyways, mean-square-error is better than nothing. IT measures how spread-out a data-set is. A\nre the data-points WAY WAY far away from the average, or all pretty close to the average?\nWhat-if 55 inches was the true average height of a 10-year-old child?\nAlso imagine \"what-if\" the true standard deviation was 4 inches.\nIn that imaginary world, suppose you randomly sampled 1,038 children, each 10 years of age.\nYour sample-variance (computed from experimental data) is 7.1091 inches.\nWhat is the likelihood that a sample of 1,038 children would have a variance of 7.1091 inches or more?\nIf your model is correct, what is the likelihood that the data would as far, or further, from the model's prediction as that you observed?\nIf the data you see is way WAY WAY far away from the predicted value, then your model is probably bad.\nAnyway the R-squared measure is:\n\n0% if the data does not match the model at all\n100% if the differences between the data and the prediction are adequately explained by random chance.\n\nFor example, if you toss a fair-coin 1,000 times, it is reasonably that 491 results would be heads instead of exactly 500 results of \"heads\".\nThe question is, is the observed value (491 heads out of 1,000 tosses) likely, or extremely weird, given the model which says that it should be about 500 out of 1,000.\n    "}

For my thesis I have to compare companies using different financial ratios using Python. The financial ratios should be balanced either by logistic regression or probit regression. I have already looked at some tutorials and these have worked with explanatory and dependent variables, but there are no dependent variables in my data set. I only need the regression to balance the different financial ratios and not to explain dependent variables. The goal is to calculate a score (\"Propensity Score\") for each company, from which I can then calculate the distance to the \"nearest\" company and thus get a proxy for comparability with other companies.\nUnfortunately, I completely lack the approach here and I can't find any instructions or examples.

I had similar questions in my mind when I had started out few years ago. Let me try and give my two cents on this.\nI suggest to go with creating a scaler for scaling X_train, store the scaler and see if use it to transform X_test. According to centrality theorem, if you have done random sampling, you should have a mean and variance similar to the population attributes. The scaler works based on these two parameters in most cases. If it is representative of the population parameters, as long as the test data is coming from same population the scaler should work. If it is not working, you need more samples for training or another sampling attempt to get X_train representative of population. \nBy doing this, you are sure the model is going to work on new samples also as long as it is generated by same process. After all, the model is not built to be tested it is meant to be in production doing some useful work.\nMy recommendation would be to go with 3) scaling X_train and use the scaler to transform X_test.\n    "}

If you have a different distribution, then a different structure will be better.  \nFor instance, if you know that in that range, [0,10**10), only a few members are present, use a set(), or if the reverse is true, with nearly every element present except for a fraction, use a negated set, ie element not in mySet.  \nIf the elements tend to cluster around small ranges, you could use a run length encoding, something like [xrange(0,10),xrange(10,15),xrange(15,100)], which you lookup into by bisecting until you find a matching range, and if the index is even, then the element is in the set.  inserts and removals involve shuffling the ranges a bit.\nIf your distribution really is dense, but you need a little more than what fits in memory (seems to be typical in practice) then you can manage memory by using mmap and wrapping the mapped file with an adaptor that uses a similar mechanism to the suggested array('I') solution already suggested.\nTo get an idea of just how compressible you can possibly get, try building a plain file with a reasonable corpus of data in packed form and then apply a general compression algorithm (such as gzip) to see how much reduction you see.  If there is much reduction, then you can probably use some sort of space optimization in your code as well.\n    "}

Then the desired computations would be the matrix multiplications [X]T[A][Y] and [X]T[A][X].

So you can get XTAY as crossprod(X, A %*% Y) without having to worry about the mechanics of matrix multiplication, loops, or whatever.\nIf your matrices have a particular structure that allows optimising the computations (symmetric, triangular, sparse, banded, ...), you could look at the Matrix package, which has some support for this.\nI haven't used Matlab, but I'm sure it would have similar functions for these operations.\n    "}

Then for each timestep, I want to update the visualization window with the latest set of ties between nodes. So I would start with a set of nodes positioned in space, and then with each timestep the visualization will gradually add the new edges. \nThe challenge here is that I know in something like networkx, redrawing the network at each timestep won't work. Many of the common network display algorithms randomly place nodes so that as to maximize the distance between thenm and better show the edges. So if I were to redraw the network at each timestep, the nodes would end up in different locations each time, and it would be hard to identify the pattern of network growth. That is why I want a set of static nodes, so I can see how the edges get added at each timestep.\nI am looking to visualize about 100 nodes at a time. So I will start with a small number of nodes like 20 or so, and gradually build up to 100 nodes. After the model is validated, then I would build up to 1000 or 2000 nodes. Of course it is hard to visualize 1000 or 2000 node network, that is why I just want to make sure I can visualize the network when I just have 100 nodes in the simulation.\nI was not sure if I could do this in webgl or something, or if there is a good way to do this in python. I can use Vispy for communication between python and webgl if needed.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>This looks like a good use-case for Vispy indeed. You'd need to use a PointVisual for the nodes, and a LineVisual for the edges. Then you can update the edges in real time as the simulation is executed.\nThe animation would also work in the IPython notebook with WebGL.\nNote that other graphics toolkits might also work for you (although you'd not necessarily have GPU acceleration through OpenGL) if you specify static positions for the nodes. I think you can fix the nodes positions with d3js or networkx instead of relying on an automatic layout algorithm.\n    "}

However, all the variables-objects of the program will be stored in memory in any way. The only solution is the serialization of the data (save in filesystem, Database etc.).\nSo, in your case, you could create a customized function that would create the list of the permutations. But, instead of adding each element of the permutation to a list, it would save the element either in a file (or in a database with the corresponding structure). Then, you would be able to retrieve one-by-one each permutation from the file (or the database), without bringing the whole list in memory.\nHowever, as mentioned before, you will have to always know in which permutation you currently are. In order to avoid retrieving all the created permutations from Database (which would create the same bottleneck), you could have an index for each place holding the symbol used in the previously generated permutation (and create the permutations adding the symbols and a predefined sequence).\n    "}

I can't find any connection with the size of the original corpus (tokens, lines etc.) or deviation from the target value (if I increase the output value to e.g. 3500 it outputs 3207 words).\nI would like to understand why this is the case, unfortunately I can't find anything on Google and therefore I don't know how to solve the problem. maybe by increasing the value and later deleting all rows after 2501 by using pandas\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If any Python list ranged-access, like my_list[:n], returns less than n items, then the original list my_list had less than n items in it.\nSo, if model.wv.index_to_key[:2500] is only returning a list of length 1948, then I'm pretty sure if you check len(model.wv.index_to_key), you'll see the source list is only 1948 items long. And of course, you can't take the 1st 2500 items from a list that's only 1948 items long!\nWhy might your model have fewer unique words than you expect, or even that you counted via other methods?\nSomething might be amiss in your preprocessing\/tokenization, but most likely is that you're not considering the effect of the default min_count=5 parameter. That default causes all words that appear fewer than 5 times to be ignored during training, as if they weren't even in the source texts.\nYou may be tempted to use min_count=1, to keep all words, but that's almost always a bad idea in word2vec training. Word2vec needs many subtly-contrasting alternate uses of a word to train a good word-vector.\nKeeping words which only have one, or a few, usage examples winds up not failing to get good generalizable vectors for those rare words, but also interferes with the full learning of vectors for other nearby more-frequent words – now that their training has to fight the noise & extra model-cycles from the insufficiently-represented rare words.\nInstead of lowering min_count, it's better to get more data, or live with a smaller final vocabulary.\n    "}

Changing the size of an ndarray will create a new array and delete the original. So it is more memory efficient than the other.\nThe elements in a NumPy array are all required to be of the same data type, and thus will be the same size in memory. The exception: one can have arrays of (Python, including NumPy) objects, thereby allowing for arrays of different sized elements.\nNumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences.\nA growing plethora of scientific and mathematical Python-based packages are using NumPy arrays; though these typically support Python-sequence input, they convert such input to NumPy arrays prior to processing, and they often output NumPy arrays. In other words, in order to efficiently use much (perhaps even most) of today’s scientific\/mathematical Python-based software, just knowing how to use Python’s built-in sequence types is insufficient - one also needs to know how to use NumPy arrays.\n-Vector operations comes handy in Numpy. You don't need to go through writing loops but yet pythonic.\n-Object oriented approach\n    "}

In the past while working on Java platform, I used to write Java codes(say, to push or pull data from MySQL database etc.) then create a war file which essentially bundles all the class files, supporting files etc and put it under a servlet container like Tomcat and this becomes a web service and can be invoked from any platform. \nIn my current scenario, I've majority of work being done in Java, however the Natural Language Processing(NLP)\/Machine Learning(ML) part is being done in Python using the NLTK, Scipy, Numpy etc libraries. I'm trying to use the services of this Python engine in existing Java code. Integrating the Python code to Java through something like Jython is not that straight-forward(as Jython does not support calling any python module which has C based extensions, as far as I know), So I thought the next option would be to make it a web service, similar to what I had done with Java web services in the past. Now comes the actual crux of the question, how do I run the ML engine as a web service and call the same from any platform, in my current scenario this happens to be Java. I tried looking in the web, for various options to achieve this and found things like CherryPy, Werkzeug etc but not able to find the right approach or any sample code or anything that shows how to invoke a NLTK-Python script and serve the result through web, and eventually replicating the functionality Java web service provides. In the Python-NLTK code, the ML engine does a data-training on a large corpus(this takes 3-4 minutes) and we don't want the Python code to go through this step every time a method is invoked. If I make it a web service, the data-training will happen only once, when the service starts and then the service is ready to be invoked and use the already trained engine. \nNow coming back to the problem, I'm pretty new to this web service things in Python and would appreciate any pointers on how to achieve this .Also, any pointers on achieving the goal of calling NLTK based python scripts from Java, without using web services approach and which can deployed on production servers to give good performance would also be helpful and appreciable.

Is that parrot sitting on a perch and staring at the camera or is it a picture of a parrot on the wall?\nIn the past I've made a collection of frames from the camera and formed a reference image by taking the median value of every pixel. Hopefully, this is now an imge that can be compared with every subsequent frame and now substracting the two can be used to isolate where change has occurred. The difference isn't what you want but can be turned into a mask that will select what you want from the frame in question.\n    "}
{"text":"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n    Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\n    Today Date: 1 January 2025\n\n    You are a helpful ML assistant\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>My question is about forward and backward propagation for deep neural networks when the number of hidden units is greater than 1. \nI know what I have to do if I have a single hidden layer. In case of a single hidden layer, if my input data X_train has n samples, with d number of features (i.e. X_train is a (n, d) dimensional matrix, y_train is a (n,1)  dimensional vector) and if I have h1 number of hidden units in my first hidden layer, then I use Z_h1 = (X_train * w_h1) + b_h1 (where w_h1 is a weight matrix with random number entries which has the shape (d, h1) and b_h1 is a bias unit with shape (h1,1). I use sigmoid activation A_h1 = sigmoid(Z_h1) and find that both A_h1 and Z_h1 have shapes (n, h1). If I have t number of output units, then I use a weight matrix w_out with dimensions (h1, t) and b_out with shape (t,1) to get the output Z_out = (A_h1 * w_h1) + b_h1. From here I can get A_out = sigmoid(Z_out) \n which has shape (n, t). If I have a 2nd hidden layer (with h2 number of units) after the 1st hidden layer and before the output layer, then what steps must I add to the forward propagation and which steps should I modify?\nI also have idea about how to tackle backpropagation in case of single hidden layer neural networks. For the single hidden layer example in the previous paragraph, I know that in the first backpropagation step (output layer -> hidden layer1), I should do Step1_BP1: Err_out = A_out - y_train_onehot (here y_train_onehot is the onehot representation of y_train. Err_out has shape (n,t). This is followed by Step2_BP1: delta_w_out = (A_h1)^T * Err_out and delta_b_out = sum(Err_out). The symbol (.)^T denotes the transpose of matrix. For the second backpropagation step (hidden layer1 -> input layer), we do the following Step1_BP2: sig_deriv_h1 = (A_h1) * (1-A_h1). Here sig_deriv_h1 has shape (n,h1). In the next step, I do Step2_BP2: Err_h1 = \\Sum_i \\Sum_j [ ( Err_out * w_out.T)_{i,j} * sig_deriv_h1__{i,j} )]. Here, Err_h1 has shape (n,h1). In the final step, I do Step3_BP2: delta_w_h1 = (X_train)^T  * Err_h1 and delta_b_h1 = sum(Err_h1). What backpropagation steps should I add if I have a 2nd hidden layer (h2 number of units) after the 1st hidden layer and before the output layer? Should I modify the backpropagation steps for the one hidden layer case that I have described here?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For Forward Propagation, the dimension of the output from the first hidden layer must cope up with the dimensions of the second input layer.\nAs mentioned above, your input has dimension (n,d). The output from hidden layer1 will have a dimension of (n,h1). So the weights and bias for the second hidden layer must be (h1,h2) and (h1,h2) respectively.\nSo w_h2 will be of dimension (h1,h2) and b_h2 will be (h1,h2).\nThe dimensions for the weights and bias for the output layer will be w_output will be of dimension (h2,1) and b_output will be (h2,1).\nThe same you have to repeat in Backpropagation.\n    "}

If you have e.g. a CT and an MRI for each subject, then co-registration using the CT images is likely going to give you better results because of intrinsic image characteristics (e.g. less distortion, image value linked to physical quantity).\nI suppose that depends on what you want to do, but if it is important to have all imaging data in the same co-registered reference space then yes.\n\nAnother option is to try and generate an average image, and then use that as a reference to register other images to.

Is image A augmented only once before training, and this augmented version used for all epochs? Or is image A randomly augmented every epoch?\nQuestion 3\nWhen the param shuffle is set to True in the flow method, does this mean the batches are shuffled every epoch, or the images within the batches are shuffled every epoch? \nFor example, lets say our training data consists of 15 images (labeled I1 - I15) is divided into 3 batches\/mini-batches before epoch 1 starts (labeled B1, B2, B3). \nLets say before epoch 1, the images were assigned to the batches as follows:\n\nB1 = {I1, I2, I3, I4, I5}\nB2 = {I6, I7, I8, I9, I10}\nB3 = {I11, I12, I13, I14, I15}\n\nNow in epoch 1, the batches are trained in the order B1, B2, B3. \nWhen epoch 2 starts, will the images in B1, B2, B3 be shuffled so that each batch will not contain the same set of 5 images?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Question 1\nThe rotation range is [-rotation_range, rotation_range].

I.e. an image can be left rotated in one epoch and in the next epoch the same image can be right rotated.

And if yes, is there a way to maybe 'ponderate' the trainings so relations coming from my custom documents would be 'more important'.\nMy final wish is to compute cosine similarity between documents that can be very scientific (that's why to have better results I thought about adding more scientific documents)\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Adjusting more-generic models with your specific domain training data is often called \"fine-tuning\". \nThe gensim implementation of FastText allows an existing model to expand its known-vocabulary via what's seen in new training data (via build_vocab(..., update=True)) and then for further training cycles including that new vocabulary to occur (through train()). \nBut, doing this particular form of updating introduces murky issues of balance between older and newer training data, with no clear best practices. \nAs just one example, to the extent there are tokens\/ngrams in the original model that don't recur in the new data, new training is pulling those in the new data into new positions that are optimal for the new data... but potentially arbitrarily far from comparable compatibility with the older tokens\/ngrams.)\nFurther, it's likely some model modes (like negative-sampling versus hierarchical-softmax), and some mixes of data, have a better chance of net-benefiting from this approach than others – but you pretty much have to hammer out the tradeoffs yourself, without general rules to rely upon. \n(There may be better fine-tuning strategies for other kinds models; this is just speaking to the ability of the gensim FastText to update-vocabulary and repeat-train.)\nBut perhaps, your domain of interest is scientific texts. And maybe you also have a lot of representative texts – perhaps even, at training time, the complete universe of papers you'll want to compare. \nIn that case, are you sure you want to deal with the complexity of starting with a more-generic word-model? Why would you want to contaminate your analysis with any of the dominant word-senses in generic reference material, like Wikipedia, if in fact you already have sufficiently-varied and representative examples of your domain words in your domain contexts?\nSo I would recommend 1st trying to train your own model, from your own representative data. And only if you then fear you're missing important words\/senses, try mixing in Wikipedia-derived senses. (At that point, another way to mix in that influence would be to mix Wikipedia texts with your other corpus. And  you should also be ready to test whether that really helps or hurts – because it could be either.)\nAlso, to the extent your real goal is comparing full papers, you might want to look into other document-modeling strategies, including bag-of-words representations, the Doc2Vec ('Paragraph Vector') implementation in gensim, or others. Those approaches will not necessarily require per-word vectors as an input, but might still work well for quantifying text-to-text similarities.\n    "}

However, ET will only evaluate a random few break points and pick the best of these. ET can bootstrap samples to each tree or use all samples. RF must use bootstrap to work well.\nxgboost is an implementation of gradient boosting and can work with decision trees, typical smaller trees. Each tree is trained to correct the residuals of previous trained trees. Gradient boosting can be more difficult to train, but can achieve a lower model bias than RF.

It uses LAPACK or BLAS and may use parallel code internally.\nIf you end up rolling your own, please note that SciPy\/NumPy does all the heavy lifting with different highly optimized linear algebra packages, not in pure Python. Due to this the performance and degree of parallelism depends heavily on the libraries your SciPy\/NumPy installation is compiled with.\n(Your question does not reveal if you just want to have parallel code running on several processors, or on several computers.

Then they all leave the queue at a fixed rate.\nThis is done real time with production. I can estimate the volume for each SKU but I can't predict the order in which they will arrive at the classification\/sorting facility. However I can look at previous manufacturing data to test the algorithm.\nThe key point is how would you estimate the needed bins\/queues to accomplish the sorting (minimizing the \"all queues used\" condition)\nI thought of queue theory but I want to run some simulations with the known data (data is not totally random) and most of what I searched assumes random entry to queues.\nI'm starting to write a python script to model the queue behavior myself with given fixed times for queue evacuation.\nAny suggestions?\nThanks in advance.\nIdeally should be python based\nThe expected output should be the used queues vs time and, in case of a limited number of queues, the number of boxes \"discarded\" vs time\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Your question is frustratingly vague. I think I understand what you're asking for, but a little more detail would help.\nAs I understand it, you have something like an order processing facility, where each order is a queue in which you hold items until all the items for the order arrive. Then you release that queue at some rate (x seconds per item, or something like that).\nThe number of queues you need will depend on:\n\nThe expected delivery rate: how many orders per minute do you want to complete? Call this OPM: Orders Per Minute.\nThe average amount of time a queue lives. That is, time from when the first item arrives in the queue until the last item leaves. QLT: Queue Lifetime\n\nThe number of queues you need is OPM * QLT. If you want to deliver 100 orders per minute, and the average queue lifetime is 3 minutes. You will need 300 queues. If the average queue lifetime is 30 seconds, then you only need 50 queues.\nThe queue lifetime is a combination of how long it takes to fill the queue, and how long it takes to empty it. Call those QFT and QET. QET is easy: the average number of items in an order, divided by the queue empty rate. You said that items are released from the queue at a fixed rate. If the average order size is 5 items, and you empty the queue at a rate of 12 items per minute, then it will take 5\/12 minutes (25 seconds) to empty the queue.\nQFT (queue fill time) depends on the average order size and the average time it takes an item to be picked and delivered to the queue. If you can't get that from your manufacturing data, then you'll have to estimate it yourself.\nDoing those calculations gives you a good estimate of how your system should react on average. You can then build a simple simulation using those numbers, and begin varying one or more of the parameters. For example, what happens if the average number of items per order gets larger or smaller for a period. If it gets larger, then QLT will probably increase. If it gets smaller, QLT will decrease, but you'll probably have more concurrent orders (and thus need more queues).\n    "}

Is multiprocessing just not appropriate for an HPC cluster?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Unfortunately I wasn't able to find an answer in the community. However, through experimentation, I was able to better isolate the problem and find a workable solution.\nThe problem arises from the nature of Python's multiprocessing implementation. When a Pool object is created (i.e. the manager class that controls the processing cores for the parallel work), a new Python run-time is started for each core. There are multiple places in my code where the multiprocessing package is used and a Pool object instantiated... every function that requires it creates a Pool object as needed and then joins and terminates before exiting. Therefore, if I call the function 3 times in the code, 8 instances of Python are spun up and then closed 3 times. On a single machine, the overhead of this was not significant at all compared to the computational load of the functions... however on the HPC it was absurdly high.\nI re-architected the code so that a Pool object is created at the very beginning of the calling of process and then passed to each function as needed. It is closed, joined, and terminated at the end of the overall process.\nWe found that the bulk of the time was spent in the creation of the Pool object on each node. This was an improvement though because it was only being created once! We then realized that the underlying problem was that multiple nodes were trying to access Python at the same time in the same place from over the network (it was only installed on the head node). We installed Python and the application on all nodes, and the problem was completely fixed.\nThis solution was the result of trial and error... unfortunately our knowledge of cluster computing is pretty low at this point. I share this answer in the hopes that it will be critiqued so that we can obtain even more insight. Thank you for your time.\n    "}

More concretely, a 3x3x3 tensor would be stored simply as a single array of 27 values, one after the other. \nThe only place where the dimensions are used is to calculate the mapping between the (many) coordinates and the offset within that array. For example, to fetch the item [3, 1, 1] you would need to know if it is a 3x3x3 matrix, a 9x3x1 matrix, or a 27x1x1 matrix - in all cases the \"storage\" would be 27 items long, but the interpretation of \"coordinates\" would be different. If you use zero-based indexing, the calculation is trivial, but you need to know the length of each dimension.\nThis does mean that resizing and similar operations may require copying the whole array, but that's ok, you trade off the performance of those (rare) operations to gain performance for the much more common operations, e.g. sequential reads.\n    "}

So calculating probabilities for 3-grams and more are really time-consuming.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If I'm understanding your problem correctly, you want to compute things like log { P(\"x1 x2 x3 x4 x5\") \/ P(\"x1\") P(\"x2\") ... P(\"x5\") } where P measures the probability that any given 5-gram or 1-gram is a given thing (and is basically a ratio of counts, perhaps with Laplace-style offsets). So, make a single pass through your corpus and store counts of (1) each 1-gram, (2) each n-gram (use a dict for the latter), and then for each external n-gram you do a few dict lookups, a bit of arithmetic, and you're done. One pass through the corpus at the start, then a fixed amount of work per external n-gram.\n(Note: Actually I'm not sure how one defines PMI for more than two random variables; perhaps it's something like log P(a)P(b)P(c)P(abc) \/ P(ab)P(bc)P(a_c). But if it's anything at all along those lines, you can do it the same way: iterate through your corpus counting lots of things, and then all the probabilities you need are simply ratios of the counts, perhaps with Laplace-ish corrections.)\nIf your corpus is so big that you can't fit the n-gram dict in memory, then divide it into kinda-memory-sized chunks, compute n-gram dicts for each chunk and store them on disc in a form that lets you get at any given n-gram's entry reasonably efficiently; then, for each extern n-gram, go through the chunks and add up the counts.\nWhat form? Up to you. One simple option: in lexicographic order of the n-gram (note: if you're working with words rather than letters, you may want to begin by turning words into numbers; you'll want a single preliminary pass over your corpus to do this); then finding the n-gram you want is a binary search or something of the kind, which with chunks 1GB in size would mean somewhere on the order of 15-20 seeks per chunk; you could add some extra indexing to reduce this. Or: use a hash table on disc, with Berkeley DB or something; in that case you can forgo the chunking. Or, if the alphabet is small (e.g., these are letter n-grams rather than word n-grams and you're processing plain English text), just store them in a big array, with direct lookup -- but in that case, you can probably fit the whole thing in memory anyway.\n    "}

Since we have WxH pixels, and the window is DXxDY, then the full array is WxHxDXxDY of costs. So it's 4D but they call it a \"cost volume\" by analogy.\nYou also find cost volumes in stereo, for WxH images, and D possible depths or disparities, we can build a WxHxD cost volume.

I want to be able to do this for two types of data: \n\nany textual data\nstrings of binary digits of the same length.\n\nIs there an efficient way of doing this in python?

TIA.\nAn example to try to clarify what I am aiming to do:\nList A: car, dig, dog, the.\nList B: fish, the, dog.\n(No repeats in any list. Not sorted although I suppose they could be fairly easily. Size of lists varies.)\nResult:2, since 'dog' and 'the' are in both lists. \nIn reality the length of each list can be thousands and there are around 1000 such lists, each having to be compared with every other.\nContinuing the example:\nList C: dog, the, a, fish, fry.\nResults:\nAB: 2\nAC: 2\nBC: 3\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Nothing is going to be superfast, and there's a lot of data there (half a million results, to start with), but the following should fit in your time and space budget on modern hardware.\nIf possible, start by sorting the lists by length, from longest to shortest. (I don't mean sort each lists; the order of elements in the list is irrelevant. I mean, sort the collection of lists so that you can process the longest list first.) The only point of doing this is to allow the similarity metrics to be stored in a half-diagonal matrix instead of full matrix, which saves half the matrix space. So if you don't know the length of the lists before you start, it's not a crisis; it just means that you'll need a bit more space.\nNote 1: The important thing is that the metric you propose is completely symmetric as long as no list has repeated elements.Without repeated elements, the metric is simply |A⋂B|, regardless of whether A or B is longer, so when you compute the size of the intersection of A and B you could fill in the similarity matrix for both (A,B) and (B,A).)\nNote 2: The description of the algorithm seemed confusing to me when I reread it so I changed the word \"list\" to \"list\" when it refers to one of the thousand input lists, leaving \"list\" to mean an ordinary Python list. Because lists can't be keys in Python dictionaries, working on the assumption that lists are implemented as lists, it's necessary to somehow identify each list with an identifier which can be used as a key. I hope that's clear.\nThe Algorithm:\nWe need two auxiliary structures: one is the (half-diagonal) result matrix, keyed by pairs of list identifiers, which we initialize to all 0s. The other one is a dictionary keyed by unique data element, mapping onto a list of list identifiers.\nThen, taking each list in turn, for each element in that list we do the following:\n\nIf the element is not yet present in the dictionary, add it, mapping to a single element list consisting of the current list's identifier.\nIf the element is present in the dictionary but the last element in the corresponding list of ids is the current id, then we've found a repeated element. Since we don't expect repeated elements, either ignore it or issue an error message.\nOtherwise, we've seen the element before and we have a list of identifiers of lists in which the element appears. For each such identifier, increment the similarity count between the current identifier and the identifier in the list. (Note that if we scan lists in reverse order by length, all the identifiers in the list correspond to lists which are at least as long as the current list, which is why we sorted the lists in the first place.) Finally, append the current identifier to the end of the list, so that the next time that data element is found, the current list will be present.\n\nThat's it. The space requirement is O(N2 + M) where N is the number of lists and M is the total size of all the lists. The time requirement is essentially O(M2) in the worst case -- that being the case where every list has exactly one element and they are all the same element. (More precisely, it's the sum of the squares of the frequencies of each unique element.)\n    "}

I never felt I would miss out on anything! It was rather the other way around that with Matlab I was missing all the general purpose stuff and the \"batteries included\" nature of Python. The number of freely available libraries for Python is just overwhelming.\nOn top, basing your work on an open source project pays back. As a student, you can simply install Python on all the machines that matter to you (no additional costs), you can benefit from reading the source of others (great learning experience), and once you are doing some \"production\" stuff later on, you have the power to fix stuff yourself.

Usually, with any two elements from \"A\" and \"B,\" the result of the operation is a float, and the the element in the output array that corresponds to that operation shows up as a float. But strangely, even if the output is supposed to be an integer (almost always 0 or 1), the integer will show up as \"0.\" or \"1.\" in the output array. Is there any way to turn these specific elements of the array back into integers, rather than keep them as floats?\nI'd like to write a simple if statement that will convert any output elements that are supposed to be integers back into integers (i.e., make \"0.\" into \"0\"). But I'm having some trouble with that. Any ideas?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The strength of Numpy arrays is that many low-level operations can be quickly performed on the data because most (not all) types used by these arrays have a fixed-size in memory. For instance, the floats you are using probably require 8 bytes each. The most important thing in that case is that all datas share the same type and fit in the same amount of memory. You can play a little around that if you really want (and need) to, but I would not suggest you to start by such special cases. Try to learn the strength of these arrays when used with this requirement (but this involves accepting the fact that you can't mix integers and floats in the same array).\n    "}

Oracle 10G is the database server.\nOptions I am considering,\n\nSmooks - However the problem is that Smooks serializes one CSV at a time and I cant afford to hold on to the half baked java beans til the other CSV files are read since I run the risk of running out of memory given the sheer number of beans I would need to create and hold on to before they are fully populated written to disk as XML.\nSQLLoader - I could skip the XML creation all together and load the CSV directly to the staging tables using SQLLoader. But I am not sure if I can a. load multiple CSV files in SQL Loader to the same tables updating the records after the first file. b. Apply some translation rules while loading the staging tables.\nPython script to convert the CSV to XML.\nSQLLoader to load a different set of staging tables corresponding to the CSV data and then writing stored procedure to load the actual staging tables from this new set of staging tables (a path which I want to avoid given the amount of changes to my existing framework it would need).\n\nThanks in advance. If someone can point me in the right direction or give me some insights from his\/her personal experience it will help me make an informed decision.\nregards,\n-v-\nPS: The CSV files are fairly simple with around 40 columns each. The depth of objects or relationship between the files would be around 2 to 3.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Create a process \/ script that will call a procedure to load csv files to external Oracle table and another script to load it to the destination table.\nYou can also add cron jobs to call these scripts that will keep track of incoming csv files into the directory, process it and move the csv file to an output\/processed folder.\nExceptions also can be handled accordingly by logging it or sending out an email. Good Luck.\n    "}

For experiments I want to artificially down-sample these images, keeping the image size constant. For example I have a 512x512 image with spatial resolution 0.3m\/pixel. I want to downsample it to 0.5m\/pixel 512x512. I got advised to apply a Gaussian kernel to blur the image. But how do I calculate the standard deviation and kernel size of a Gaussian kernel to approximate the desired lower resolution? I can't find a rigorous method to do that calculation. Any help really much appreciated!\nChatGTP says that the formula is:\nsigma = (desired_resolution \/ current_resolution) \/ (2 * sqrt(2 * log(2)))\nand kernel_size = 2 * ceil(2 * sigma) + 1\nBut can't explain why. Can someone explain how standard deviation (sigma) and desired output resolution are connected? And how do I know which sigma to use? Oftentimes these existing resizing functions ask for a sigma, but in their documentation don't explain how to derive it.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I wonder where that equation for the sigma comes from, I have never seen it. It is hard to define a cutoff frequency for the Gaussian.\nThe Gaussian filter is quite compact in both the spatial domain and the frequency domain, and therefore is an extremely good low-pass filter. But it has no clear point at which it attenuates all higher frequencies sufficiently to no longer produce visible aliasing artifacts, without also attenuating lower frequencies so much that the downsampled image looks blurry.\nOf course we can follow the tradition from the field of electronics, and define the cutoff frequency as the frequency above which the signal gets attenuated with at least 3dB. I think this definition might have lead to the equation in the OP, though I don’t feel like attempting to replicate that computation.\nFrom personal experience, I find 0.5 times the subsampling factor to be a good compromise for regular images. For example, to downsample by a factor of 2, I’d apply a Gaussian filter with sigma 1.0 first. For OP’s example of going from 0.3 to 0.5 m per pixel, the downsampling factor is 0.5\/0.3 = 1.667, half that is 0.833.\nNote that a Gaussian kernel with a sigma below 0.8 cannot be sampled properly without excessive aliasing, applying a Gaussian filter with a smaller sigma should be done through multiplication in the frequency domain.\nFinally, the kernel size. The Gaussian is infinite in size, but it becomes nearly zero very quickly, and we can truncate it without too much loss. The calculation 2 * ceil(2 * sigma) + 1 takes the central portion of the Gaussian of at least four sigma, two sigma to either side. The ceiling operation is the “at least”, it needs to be an integer size of course. The +1 accounts for the central pixel. This equation always produces an odd size kernel, so it can be symmetric around the origin.\nHowever, two sigma is quite small for a Gaussian filter, it cuts off too much of the bell shape, affecting some of the good qualities of the filter. I always recommend using three sigma to either side: 2 * ceil(3 * sigma) + 1. For some applications the difference might not matter, but if your goal is to quantify, I would certainly try to avoid any sources of error.\n    "}

How is it a coding practice, if it is also a feature you have or you don't have in the framework you are using. \n\nA more concrete explanation of my dilemma: \n\nLet's say I have a loop to calculate an operation on a list of numbers in Python. To vectorize it, I just import Numpy and then use an array function to do the calculation in one step instead of having to write a time consuming loop. The low level C routines used by Numpy will do all the heavy lifting on my behalf. \n\nKnowing about Numpy and how to import it and use it is not a coding practice, as far as I can tell. It's just good knowledge of tools and frameworks, that's all. \nSo why do people keep referring to vectorization as a coding practice that good coders leverage in their code?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Vectorization leverage the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instruction set of modern processors. For example, assume your data is 32 bits, back in the old days one addition would cost one instruction (say 4 clock cycles depending on the architecture). Intel's latest SIMD instructions now process 512 bits of data all at once with one instruction, enabling you to make 16 additions in parallel.\nUnless you are writing assembly code, you better make sure that your code is efficiently compiled to leverage the SIMD instruction set. This is being taking care of with the standard packages. \nYour next speed up opportunities are in writing code to leverage multicore processors and to move your loops out of the interpreted python. Again, this is being taking care of with libraries and frameworks.\nIf you are a data scientist, you should only care about calling the right packages\/frameworks, avoid reimplementing logic already offered by the libraries (with loops being a major example) and just focus on your application. If you are a framework\/low-level code developer, you better learn the good coding practices or your package will never fly.\n    "}

For example, if product is 'XXX', then you want to know to which row of the first dimension (as product is the first dimension of your array) 'XXX' corresponds; same idea for store and week. Once you have all of this, you can simply iterate through all lines of your existing array and assign the value of quantity to the correct location inside your new array based on the indices stored in your conversion matrices for each value of product, store and week.

Specifically, what is the relationship between:\n\nnd-array and Python list?\nnd-array and Python dictionary?\nnd-array and Pandas DataFrame?\nnd-arrays and Numpy \"structured arrays\"?\n\nAlso, is nd-array just like a sequence of lists? \nWhere does the \"n-dimension\" come into the picture? Because it looks just like a matrix, which is just two dimensions.\nThanks!\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>ndarray vs list: both can hold a 1-dimensional collection of elements; however, in an ndarray the elements would usually all be of the same type (e.g., 64-bit floating point numbers), and numpy provides operators (and behind-the-scenes optimizations) for calculations on these vectors. For example, you can (quickly) add elements in nda1 and nda2 via nda3 = nda1 + nda2. With lists, you would need to do lst3 = [a + b for (a, b) in zip(lst1, lst2)]. On the other hand, you can easily insert and remove items in lists. ndarrays are designed for high-performance computations on vectors of numbers; lists are designed for ad hoc operations on arbitrary collections of objects.\nndarray vs dictionary: these are quite dissimilar. Dictionaries allow you to select objects from an arbitrary collection by name; ndarrays usually only hold numbers, and only allow lookup via index number (unless you get into recarrays, which you didn't ask about).  \nndarray vs Pandas dataframe: dataframes are somewhat similar to multidimensional ndarrays, in that they are designed to hold similar types of data in each column. However, different columns of a dataframe would often hold different types of data, while all the elements in a multidimensional ndarray would usually be numbers of the same type. In addition, dataframes provide name-based indexing across rows and columns. I like to think of dataframes as something like a dictionary of 1-dimensional ndarrays, i.e., each column of the dataframe is like a 1-dimensional ndarray, and you can retrieve the column by name and then manipulate it. But Pandas provides additional indexing goodness, so you can also give a name to each row, and then pull elements out of the table based on both their row and column names. Pandas also provides operators for element-wise operations (e.g., adding two columns together), similar to numpy. But it generally does this by matching index terms, not row\/column numbers. So data manipulations in Pandas are slower but more reliable.\nndarrays vs structured arrays: structured arrays are somewhat like the rows of a Pandas dataframe (you can have different standardized types of data in each column). But the semantics for manipulating them are more like standard numpy operations -- you have to make sure the right data is in the right spot in the array before you operate on it. (Pandas will re-sort the tables so the row-names match if needed.)\nndarray vs sequence of lists: ndarrays are initialized and displayed like sequences of lists, and if you take the nth element of a 2D array, you get a list (the row). But internally, in an ndarray, every element has the same datatype (unlike lists), and the values are packed tightly and uniformly in memory. This allows processors to quickly perform operations on all the values together. Lists are more like pointers to values stored elsewhere, and mathematical computations on lists or lists-of-lists are not optimized. Also, you can't use 2D or 3D indexing with lists-of-lists (you have to say lst[1][2][3], not lst[1, 2, 3]), nor can you easily do elementwise operations (lst1+lst2 does not do elementwise addition like nda1+nda2).\nhigher dimensions: you can create an ndarray with any number of dimensions. This is sort of similar to a list of lists of lists. e.g., this makes a 3D array: np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7,8]]])\n    "}

And made two tfrecords from them. \nNow I want to train a pretrained model however, I'm just curious will it work? When it is possible that an image for example \"001.jpg\" will have of course some annotated bounding boxes of cars (it is from the car dataset) but if there is a traffic light as well it wouldn't be annotated -> will it lead to bad learning rate? (there can be many of theese \"problematic\" images) How should I improve this? Is there any workaround?

This means that the model will only detect traffic lights on images from the domain of the first dataset, and cars on the second.\nIn fact I tried doing so myself in a different setup, and got this outcome.\n\nIn order to be able to learn your objective of learning traffic lights and cars no matter which dataset they come from, you'll need to modify your loss function. You need to tell the loss function from which dataset each image comes from, and then only compute the loss on the corresponding classes (\/zero out the loss on the classes do not correspond to it). So returning to our example, you only compute loss and backpropagate traffic lights on the first dataset, and cars on the second.\nFor completeness I will add that if resources are available, then the better option is to annotate all the classes on all datasets in order to avoid the suggested modification, since by only backpropagating certain classes, you do not enjoy using actual false examples for other classes.\n    "}

By default, it applies l2 norm. \nThe difference would come based the classification model, which you are using. Try changing the model also as a last option.\n    "}

I was told that Anaconda is basically a python installation with all the packages I need (e.g. numpy, scipy, sci-kit learn etc). \nHowever, when I create a new environment, none of these packages is readily available. I cannot import them when using PyCharm with the newly created environment. When I check the Pycharm project interpreter, or the anaconda navigator environments tab, It seems that indeed none of these packages are installed in my new environments. Why is this?

This might include different packages, different environment variables etc. \nThe whole point of making a new virtual environment is to have a separate place where you can install all the binaries ( and other resources ) required for your project. If you have some pre-installed binaries in the environment, doesn't it defeat the purpose of creating one in the first place?\nThe fact that you can create multiple environments helps you to separate binaries that might be needed by one and not by the other. \nFor instance, if you are creating a project which requires numpy:1.1 but you have numpy:2.1 installed , then you have to change it. So basically, by not installing any other packages, they are not making assumptions about your project's requirements.\n    "}

I do this by calculating the cosine similarity of the vectors, which works fine. \nBut, to cluster the documents HDBSCAN requires a distance matrix, and not a similarity matrix. The native conversion from cosine similarity to cosine distance in sklearn is 1-similarity. However, it is my understanding that using this formula can break the triangle inequality preventing it from being a true distance metric.

The choice is not based on a proper theoretical analysis for all I know.\nHDBSCAN does not require a metric. The 1-sim transformation assumes that x is bounded by 1, so that won't reliably work.\nI suggest to try the following approaches:\n\nuse negative distances. That may simply work. I.e., d(x,y)=-(x dot y)\nuse max-sim transformation. Once you have the dot product matrix it is easy to get the maximum value.\nimplement HDBSCAN* with a similarity rather than a metric\n    "}

I'm trying to understand the deployment unit.. a trained model. What does a trained model look like on a file system, what does it contain? \nI understand the concept of training a model, and splitting a set of data into a training set and testing set, but lets say I have a notebook (python \/ jupyter) and I load in some data, split between training\/testing data, and run an algorithm to \"train\" my model. What is my deliverable under the hood? While I'm training a model I'd think there'd be a certain amount of data being stored in memory.. so how does that become part of the trained model? It obviously can't contain all the data used for training; so for instance if I'm training a chatbot agent (retrieval-based), what is actually happening as part of that training after I'd add\/input examples of user questions or \"intents\" and what is my deployable as far as a trained model? Does this trained model contain some sort of summation of data from training or array of terms, how large (deployable size) can it get?\nWhile the question may seem relatively simple \"what is a trained model\", how would I explain it to a devops tech in simple terms?

For example linear regression, training will give you the coefficients of the slope and the intercept (generally). These are the \"model parameters\". When deployed, traditionally, these coefficients get fed into a different algorithm (literally y=mx+b), and then when queried \"what should y be, when I have x\", it responds with the appropriate value.\nKmeans clustering on the other hand the \"parameters\" are vectors, and the predict algorithm calculates distance from a vector given to the algorithm, and then returns the closest cluster - note often times these clusters are post processed, so the predict algorithm will say \"shoes\" not \"[1,2,3,5]\", which is again an example of how these things change in the wild.\nDeep learning returns a list of edge weights for a graph, various parametric systems (as in maximum likelihood estimation), return the coefficients to describe a particular distribution, for example uniform distribution is number of buckets, Gaussian\/Normal distribution is mean and variance, other more complicated ones have even more, for example skew and conditional probabilities.\n    "}

The nice thing I found with PyTorch is that I have to write my own training loop, so I can step through the code and find errors. I can fire up pdb and check the tensor shapes and transformations, etc., without difficulty.\nIn Tensorflow I was using the model.fit() function all the time, and so any error message I got was like 6 pages of C code where the error message did not give me any indication was in the python code. User's can't step through the model.fit() function since it is a static graph, so that really slowed down my development process. BUT, I was thinking about using Tensorflow again and I was wondering whether a user can step through a custom training loop and look at tensor shapes, etc., or whether even a custom training loop is compiled to a static graph and hence users cannot step through it?\nI did google this question, but all of the tutorials for custom training loops in Tensorflow focus on custom loops being for advanced users, such as if you want to apply some exotic callback while training or if you want to apply some conditional logic. So the simple question of whether it is easy to step through a custom training loop is not answered.\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Tensorflow uses eager execution, it means your graph is connected dynamically. Offcourse it’s not as dynamic as PyTorch. But, google is trying its best and incorporated a lot of features in 2.0 and beyond.\nFor writing a custom loop in Tensorflow you need to use tf.GradientTape. I would say it involves the same steps as in pytorch. Compute gradients and then update using optimizer.\n    "}

If you are using a method that has been designated for sparse data sets (FTRL, FFM, linear SVM) one possible approach is the following (note that it will introduce collisions in the features and a lot of constant columns).\nFirst allocate for each element of your sample a (as large as possible) vector V, of length D.\nFor each categorical variable, evaluate hash(var_name + \"_\" + var_value) % D. This gives you an integer i, and you can store V[i] = 1.\nTherefore, V never grows larger as new features appear. However, as soon as the number of features is large enough, some features will collide (i.e. be written at the same place) and this may result in an increased error rate...\nEdit. You can write your own vectorizer to avoid collisions. First call L the current number of features. Prepare the same vector V of length 2L (this 2 will allow you to avoid collisions as new features arrive - at least for some time, depending of the arrival rate of new features).\nStarting with an emty dictionary<input_type,int>, associate to each feature an integer. If have already seen the feature, return the int corresponding to the feature. If not, create a new entry with an integer corresponding to the new index.

I am aware of the fact that being an interpreted language Python is generally slower than Fortran for primarily CPU-intensive computational work. But then I thought using numpy would significantly improve the performance for a simple task like sorting.\nSo my test case was sorting an array\/a list of size 10,000 containing random floats using bubble sort (just a test case with many array operations, so no need to comment on the performance of the algorithm itself). My timing results are as follows (all functions use identical algorithm):\nPython3 (using numpy array, but my own function instead of numpy.sort): 33.115s\nPython3 (using list): 9.927s \nFortran (gfortran) : 0.291s\nPython3 (using numpy.sort): 0.269s (not a fair comparison, since it uses a different algorithm)\nI was surprised that operating with numpy array is ~3 times slower than with python list, and ~100 times slower than Fortran. So at this point my questions are:\n\nWhy operating with numpy array is significantly slower than python list for this test case?\nIn case an algorithm that I need is not already implemented in scipy\/numpy, and I need to write my own function within Python framework with best performance in mind, which data type I should operate with: numpy array or list?\nIf my applications are performance oriented, and I want to write functions with equivalent performance as in-built numpy functions (e.g. np.sort), what tools\/framework I should learn\/use?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You seem to be misunderstanding what NumPy does to speed up computations.\nThe speedup you get in NumPy does not come from NumPy using some smart way of saving data. Or compiling your Python code to C automatically.\nInstead, NumPy implements many useful algorithms in C or Fortran, numpy.sort() being one of them. These functions understand np.ndarrays as input and loop over the data in a C\/Fortran loop.\nIf you want to write fast NumPy code there are really three ways to do that:\n\nBreak down your code into NumPy operations (multiplications, dot-product, sort, broadcasting etc.)\nWrite the algorithm you want to implement in C\/Fortran and also write bindings to Python that accept np.ndarrays (internally they're a contiguous array of the type you've chosen).\nUse Numba to speed up your function by having Python Just-In-Time compile your code to machine code (with some limitations)\n    "}

For example: Breakout-v0 and Breakout-ram-v0. \nUsing Breakout-ram-v0, each observation is an array of length 128.\nQuestion: How can I transform an observation of Breakout-v0 (which is a 160 x 210 image) into the form of an observation of Breakout-ram-v0 (which is an array of length 128)?\nMy idea is to train a model on the Breakout-ram-v0 and display the trained model playing using the Breakout-v0 environment.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There's a couple ways of understanding the ram option.\nLet's say you wanted to learn pong.  If you train from the pixels, you'll likely use a convolutional net of several layers.  interestingly, the final output of the convnet is a a 1D array of features.  These you pass to a fully connected layer and maybe output the correct 'action' based on the features the convnet recognized in the image(es). Or you might use a reinforcement layer working on the 1D array of features.\nNow let's say it occurs to you that pong is very simple, and could probably be represented in a 16x16 image instead of 160x160. straight downsampling doesn't give you enough detail, so you use openCV to extract the position of the ball and paddles, and create your mini version of 16x16 pong.  with nice, crisp pixels. The computation needed is way less than your deep net to represent the essence of the game, and your new convnet is nice and small.  Then you realize you don't even need your convnet any more. you can just do a fully connected layer to each of your 16x16 pixels.\nSo, think of what you have. Now you have 2 different ways of getting a simple representation of the game, to train your fully-connected layer on. (or RL algo)\n\nyour deep convnet goes through several layers and outputs a 1D array, say of 256 features in the final layer. you pass that to the fully connected layer.\nyour manual feature extraction extracts the blobs (pattles\/ball) with OpenCV, to make a 16x16 pong. by passing that to your fully connected layer, it's really just a set of 16x16=256 'extracted features'.\n\nSo the pattern is that you find a simple way to 'represent' the state of the game, then pass that to your fully connected layers. \nEnter option 3.  The RAM of the game may just be a 256 byte array.  But you know this contains the 'state' of the game, so it's like your 16x16 version of pong. it's most likely a 'better' representation than your 16x16  because it probably has info about the direction of the ball etc.\nSo now you have 3 different ways to simplify the state of the game, in order to train your fully connected layer, or your reinforcment algorithm.\nSo, what OpenAI has done by giving you the RAM is helping you avoid the task of learning a 'representation' of the game, and that let's you move directly to learning a 'policy' or what to do based on the state of the game.\nOpenAI may provide a way to 'see' the visual output on the ram version. If they don't, you could ask them to make that available.  But that's the best you will get.  They are not going to reverse engineer the code to 'render' the RAM, nor are they going to reverse engineer the code to 'generate' 'RAM' based on pixels, which is not actually possible, since pixels are only part of the state of the game.\nThey simply provide the ram if it's easily available to them, so that you can try algorithms that learn what to do assuming there is something giving them a good state representation.  \nThere is no (easy) way to do what you asked, as in translate pixels to RAM, but most likely there is a way to ask the Atari system to give you both the ram, and the pixels, so you can work on ram but show pixels.\n    "}

I was not able to determine when cupy (or python or cuda?) does garbage collection on the disused array, but it seems to happen asynchronously.\nIf GPU garbage collection uses cuda cores (I presume it does?), it does not appear to materially effect my code execution time.

I know that the former one is the subclass of Variable and has the gradient. But I really don't understand why we introduce Parameter and when we should use it?\n\nSUMMARY:\nThanks for the explanation of iacolippo, i finally understand the difference between parameter and variable. In a summary, variable in pytorch is NOT same as in  the variable in tensorflow, the former one is not attach to the model's trainable parameters while the later one will. Attaching to the model means that using model.parameters() will return the certain parameter to you, which is useful in training phase to specify the variable needed to train. The 'variable' is more helpful as a cache in some network.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>From the documentation:\nParameters are Tensor subclasses, that have a very special property when used with Modules - when they’re assigned as Module attributes they are automatically added to the list of its parameters, and will appear e.g. in parameters() iterator. Assigning a Tensor doesn’t have such effect. This is because one might want to cache some temporary state, like last hidden state of the RNN, in the model. If there was no such class as Parameter, these temporaries would get registered too.\nThink for example when you initialize an optimizer:\noptim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)\nThe optimizer will update only registered Parameters of the model.\nVariables are still present in Pytorch 0.4 but they are deprecated. From the docs:\nThe Variable API has been deprecated: Variables are no longer necessary to use autograd with tensors. Autograd automatically supports Tensors with requires_grad set to True.\n\nPytorch pre-0.4\nIn Pytorch before version 0.4 one needed to wrap a Tensor in a torch.autograd.Variable in order to keep track of the operations applied to it and perform differentiation. From the docs of Variable in 0.3:\nWraps a tensor and records the operations applied to it.\nVariable is a thin wrapper around a Tensor object, that also holds the gradient w.r.t. to it, and a reference to a function that created it. This reference allows retracing the whole chain of operations that created the data. If the Variable has been created by the user, its grad_fn will be None and we call such objects leaf Variables.\nSince autograd only supports scalar valued function differentiation, grad size always matches the data size. Also, grad is normally only allocated for leaf variables, and will be always zero otherwise.\nThe difference wrt Parameter was more or less the same. From the docs of Parameters in 0.3:\nA kind of Variable that is to be considered a module parameter.\nParameters are Variable subclasses, that have a very special property when used with Modules - when they’re assigned as Module attributes they are automatically added to the list of its parameters, and will appear e.g. in parameters() iterator. Assigning a Variable doesn’t have such effect. This is because one might want to cache some temporary state, like last hidden state of the RNN, in the model.

I then evaluate the model by providing a batch of all positive samples and several batches of negative ones (utilising random.sample). My model gets loss of ~0.35 and 1.0 accuracy for positive samples and ~0.46 loss 0.68 accuracy for negative ones.\nMy understanding of neural networks if extremely limited, but to my understanding the above means it theoretically always is right when it outputs 0 when there's no link, but can sometimes output 1 even if there is none.\nNow for my actual problem: I try to \"reconstruct\" the original graph with my neural network via model.predict. The problem is I don't understand what the predict output means. At first I assumed values above 0.5 mean 1, else 0. But if that's the case the model doesn't even come close to rebuilding the original.\nI get that it won't be perfect, but it simply returns value above 0.5 for random link candidates.\nCan someone explain to me how exactly model.predict works and how to properly use it to rebuild my graph?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The model that you trained is not directly optimized w.r.t. the graph reconstruction. Without loss of generality, for a N-node graph, you need to predict N choose 2 links. And it may be reasonable to assume that the true values of the most of these links are 0.\nWhen looking into your model accuracy on the 0-class and 1-class, it is clear that your model is prone to predict 1-class, assuming your training data is balanced. Therefore, your reconstructed graph contains many false alarm links. This is the exact reason why the performance of your reconstruction graph is poor.\nIf it is possible to retrain the model, I suggest you do it and use more negative samples.\nIf not, you need to consider applying some post-processing. For example, instead of finding a threshold to decide which two nodes have a link, use the raw predicted link probabilities to form a node-to-node linkage matrix, and apply something like the minimum spanning tree to further decide what are appropriate links.\n    "}

Right now, the basic algorithm I'm using is quite inefficient:\n\nPut all of the streets (Street objects) into a large list\nFind every possible pair of two streets in the list using nested for loops; for each pair, draw a rectangle around the two streets and calculate the angle at which each street is oriented.\nIf the rectangles overlap, the overlapping area is big enough, and the angles are similar, the two streets in the pair are considered parallel and close to each other.\n\nThis works well for small maps but with large maps, the biggest problem obviously is that there would be a huge number of pairs to iterate through since there could be thousands of streets in a city. I want to be able to run the program on a large area (like a city) without having to split the area into smaller pieces.\nOne idea I'm thinking of is sorting the list of streets by latitude or longitude, and only comparing pairs of streets that are within, say, 50 positions away from each other in the list. It would probably be more efficient but it still doesn't seem very elegant; is there any better way?\nEach Street is composed of Node objects, and I can easily retrieve both the Node objects and the lat\/long position of each Node.

You do need to think through what happens to road segments that traverse bin boundaries.\nAnother idea is to Hough transform all the road segments. The infinite line that each segment lies on corresponds to a point in 2d Hough space: the polar angle of the line is one axis and the distance to the origin of the line's nearest point is the other.  The transformation from two points on a line to a Hough point is simple algebra. \nNow you can detect nearly co-linear road segments by using a closest point pair algorithm. Happily this can be done in O(n log n) expected time. E.g. using a k-d tree. Insert all the points in the tree. Use the standard k-d tree algorithm to find each point's nearest neighbor. Sort the pair distances and take a prefix of the result as pairs to consider, stopping where the pairs are too far apart to meet your criterion of \"nearby and parallel\".  There are O(n) of such nearest neighbor pairs.\nAll that's left is to filter out segment pairs that - though nearly co-linear - don't overlap. These segments lie on or near different parts of the same infinite line, but they're not of interest. This is just a little more algebra.\nThere are reasonably good Wikipedia articles on all of the algorithms mentioned here. Look them up if they're not familiar.\n    "}

However, the output of methods in keras.backend.* is not a Keras Tensor (it is the backend Tensor, such as TensorFlow Tensor) and therefore you can't pass them directly to a layer.\nAlthough, if there is an operation that could not be done with a layer, then you can use keras.backned.* methods in a Lambda layer to perform that custom operation\/computation.\nNote: Keras Tensor is actually the same type as the backend Tensor (e.g. tf.Tensor); however, it has been augmented with some additional Keras-specific attributes which Keras needs when building a model.\n    "}

{"text":"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n    Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\n    Today Date: 1 January 2025\n\n    You are a helpful ML assistant\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I am using scikit-learn Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for binary text classification (classifier tells me whether the document belongs to the category X or not). I use a balanced dataset to train my model and a balanced test set to test it and the results are very promising.\nThis classifer needs to run in real time and constantly analyze documents thrown at it randomly.\nHowever, when I run my classifier in production, the number of false positives is very high and therefore I end up with a very low precision. The reason is simple: there are many more negative samples that the classifer encounters in the real-time scenario (around 90 % of the time) and this does not correspond to the ideal balanced dataset I used for testing and training.\nIs there a way I can simulate this real-time case during training or are there any tricks that I can use (including pre-processing on the documents to see if they are suitable for the classifer)? \nI was planning to train my classifier using an imbalanced dataset with the same proportions as I have in real-time case but I am afraid that might bias Naive Bayes towards the negative class and lose the recall I have on the positive class.\nAny advice is appreciated.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You have encountered one of the problems with classification with a highly imbalanced class distribution. I have to disagree with those that state the problem is with the Naive Bayes method, and I'll provide an explanation which should hopefully illustrate what the problem is.\nImagine your false positive rate is 0.01, and your true positive rate is 0.9. This means your false negative rate is 0.1 and your true negative rate is 0.99.\nImagine an idealised test scenario where you have 100 test cases from each class. You'll get (in expectation) 1 false positive and 90 true positives. Great! Precision is 90 \/ (90+1) on your positive class!\nNow imagine there are 1000 times more negative examples than positive. Same 100 positive examples at test, but now there are 1000000 negative examples. You now get the same 90 true positives, but (0.01 * 1000000) = 10000 false positives. Disaster! Your precision is now almost zero (90 \/ (90+10000)).\nThe point here is that the performance of the classifier hasn't changed; false positive and true positive rates remained constant, but the balance changed and your precision figures dived as a result.\nWhat to do about it is harder. If your scores are separable but the threshold is wrong, you should look at the ROC curve for thresholds based on the posterior probability and look to see if there's somewhere where you get the kind of performance you want. If your scores are not separable, try a bunch of different classifiers and see if you can get one where they are (logistic regression is pretty much a drop-in replacement for Naive Bayes; you might want to experiment with some non-linear classifiers, however, like a neural net or non-linear SVM, as you can often end up with non-linear boundaries delineating the space of a very small class).\nTo simulate this effect from a balanced test set, you can simply multiply instance counts by an appropriate multiplier in the contingency table (for instance, if your negative class is 10x the size of the positive, make every negative instance in testing add 10 counts to the contingency table instead of 1).\nI hope that's of some help at least understanding the problem you're facing.\n    "}

Can i do this in tensorflow?\nSo my question is, Can i have combination of loss functions in a single model training on different set of train data?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>From an implementation perspective, the short answer would be yes.

So if the image has a dog, then the classifier will most likely return the class dog with a higher confidence score as compared to the other classes the network was trained on.  To train a network such as this, it's simple enough to group the same class images (all images with a dog) into folders as inputs.  ImageNet and Pascal VOC are examples of public labeled datasets for Image Classification.\nObject Detection based neural networks on the other hand, such as SSD and Yolo, will return a set of coordinates that indicate a bounding box and confident score for each class (object) that is detected based upon what the network was trained with.  To train a network such as this, each object in an image much as annotated with a set of coordinates that correspond to the bounding boxes of the class (object).  The COCO dataset, for example, is an annotated dataset of 80 classes (objects) with coordinates corresponding to the bounding box around each object.  Another popular dataset is Object365 that contains 365 classes.\nAnother important type of neural network that the COCO dataset provides annotations for is Instance Segmentation models, such as Mask RCNN.  These models provide pixel-level classification and are extremely compute-intensive, but critical for use cases such as self-driving cars.  If you search for Detectron2 tutorials, you will find several great learning examples of training a Mask RCNN network on the COCO dataset.\nSo, to answer your question, Yes, you can use the COCO dataset (amongst many other options available publicly on the web) for object detection, or, you can also create your own dataset with a little effort by annotating your own dataset with bounding boxes around the object classes you want to train.  Try Googling - 'using coco to train ssd model' to get some easy-to-follow tutorials.    SSD stands for single-shot detector and is an alternative neural network architecture to Yolo.\n    "}

I've come up with the following and am asking if there is a better way to do this or if this will even work in the first place.\nFor any given player:\n\nNormal move +0\nCapture normal piece +1\nCapture king +2\nMove resulting in king +2\nWin game +10 (Should make AI highly prefer this path unless another provides a stronger and safer short term advantage.)\nDraw Game (Disregard path unless it's the only remaining option. Static 1 Goodness Point.)\nLose Game (Disregard path unless it's the only remaining option. Static 0 Goodness Points.)\n\nI'm also toying with the following:\n\nMove that ends against a wall +0.5\nMove that gains center control without threat +0.75\nMove that results in potential capture of multiple AI pieces (per piece) -0.25\nMove that results in piece getting \"stuck\" (within 1 turn) -0.5\n\nThe AI then runs through X levels (Let's say 4) of moves deep in the search tree and tallies points for both the player and opponent for each branch.\nI track the following (per branch):\n\nTotal points for AI\nTotal points for human opponent\nOpponent likelihood of choosing branch (see below)\nBranch \"Goodness\" (see below)\nTotal branches (move combinations)\n\nIn order to choose the best one, here is the algorithm I have developed but haven't determined if it will work well yet:\nBase Opponent Move Probability = 100 \/ Total Branches * (Human Opponent Points Gained + 1)\nPlayer Branch \"Goodness\" = Human Opponent Probability * Total Points for AI Player\nThe AI then chooses the move branch with the highest \"Goodness\" points or picks one at random in event of a tie.\nExample:\n4 Branches Available. In one of them, the human will king once and the AI will capture 2 pieces and king once.\n100 \/ 4 Moves * (1 Opponent Points + 1) = 50 Human Opponent Likelihood Score\n50 Human Opponent Likelihood * 5 AI Player Points Gained = 250 Move \"Goodness\" Points\nThe only other thing I can think to add would be to score the entire board's \"favorability\" at the end of each branch and multiply that by the \"Goodness\" Score. Favorability meaning the total point score for all pieces, kings, center\/wall control as a given end state. Though the more I expand on this the more it seems like I should pick one or the other. Either score as each of the moves in a branch are calculated or score the end board favorability result of each branch, not both.\nMaybe something like: (Board Favorability \/ 2) * Goodness = Final Branch Value\nRegardless, am I on the right track here? Will this approach work (not the favorability part, the general scoring and \"Goodness\" score for a given branch) or am I on the complete wrong track? Thanks for any assistance!\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>You're on the right track, and another answer already has lots of details, but one thing I want to highlight is that you should focus on evaluating positions rather than evaluating moves. The value of a move is simply the value of the position it ends up in.\n\nInstead of awarding lots of points to a \"winning move\", you award lots of points to a won position.\nInstead of awarding some points for a capture, and some more points for a king capture, you can score positions according to material. The reason we consider a capture a good move is because it deprives the opponent of pieces. Acquiring a king improves our own material. Evaluating positions on material takes these things into consideration.\nLikewise your rules about control of the center, being against the wall, etc. are much easier to do (and work better) as evaluations of a position, rather than tallying up points for \"moves that result in X\".\n\nWin\/lose\/draw are \"hard\" conditions; if the game is over, it doesn't matter how much material you have left, or where it's placed, or anything else. You wouldn't choose a draw over a win just because the win sacrifices a piece. Evaluation rules for material, mobility, etc. are \"rules of thumb\" for how close a player is to winning, or how much ability they have to win, so you only really care about them when you don't have a forced win\/loss\/draw within your search horizon, and when you do use them, you want them to produce scores that are as similar as possible to the scores you would get if you could search every position until the end of the game.\nYou can start out assigning scores to your different evaluation rules by intuition, but to make them really good, you would simulate lots of games to the finish, and then run statistics on the winning and losing players' positions — then you would assign higher scores to the rules that most strongly correlate with positions that actually win.\n    "}

If that city has been picked before, it ignores it and picks a random line again, reducing the number of considered previous picks for that city by one.  So, say that it randomly picks San Antonio, which has been picked twice before.  The script ignores this pick, places it back into the list, reduces the number of currently considered previous San Antonio picks, then randomly chooses a line again.  IF it picks a line from San Antonio again, then it repeats the previous process, now reducing considered San Antonio picks to 0.  So it would have to pick San Antonio three times in a row to add another line from San Antonio.  For future picks, it would have to pick San Antonio four times in a row, plus one for each additional pick.\nI don't know how well the second option would work to \"scatter\" my random picks - it's just an idea, and it looks like a fun way to learn more pythonese.  Any other ideas along the same line of thought would be greatly appreciated.  Insights into statistical sampling and sample scattering would also be welcome.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>There are many ways to implement this, but the abstract algorithm should be something like this.\nFirst, to create a new CSV that meets your second critera about each state being drawn with equal probability, draw each row as follows. \n1) From the set of states, draw a state (each state is drawn with probability 1 \/ # of states). Let that state be s.\n2) From the large CSV, draw a row from the set of rows where STATE = s. \nAs you draw rows, keep a record of the number of rows drawn from a given state\/city pair. You could do this with a dictionary. Then, each time you draw a successive row, if there are any state\/city pairs equal to the cap set by the user, exclude those state\/city pairs from your conditional draw in step 2 above. This will satisfy your first requirement. \nDoes that make sense? If you get started with a bit of code that attempts to implement this, I'll happily tidy it up for you if it has any problems. \nIf you wanted to do the \"somewhat trickier\" algorithm in which the probability of selecting a city decreases with each selection, you could do that without much trouble. Basically, condition on the cities within state s after you draw s, then weight according to the number of times each city in that state has been drawn (you have this information because you've been storing it to implement the first requirement). You'll have to come up with the form of the weighting function, as it isn't implied by your description. \nAgain, if you try to code this up, I'm happy to take a look at any code you post and make suggestions.\n    "}

Some more info: the rows of the matrix represent documents, and the data in each row is a vector of tf-idf weights for that document. Each column corresponds to one term in the vocabulary. I'm using pdist to calculate cosine similarities between all pairs of papers. And I want to generate a random set of papers to compare to. \nI think that just permuting the columns will work, then, because each paper gets assigned a random set of term frequencies.

Since this is a huge matrix, that's pretty painful. In the case of the MATLAB solution, I think you'll be possibly creating two extra temporary copies, depending on how reshape works internally. I think you were on the right track by operating on columns, but the problem is that it will only scramble along columns. However, I believe if you do randperm along rows after that, you'll end up with a fully permuted matrix. This way you'll only be creating temporary variables that are, at worst, 80,000 by 1. Yes, that's two loops with 60,000 and 80,000 iterations each, but internally that's going to have to happen regardless. The algorithm is going to have to visit each memory location at least twice. You could probably do a more efficient algorithm by writing a C MEX function that operates completely in place, but I assume you'd rather not do that.\n    "}

Along with a hash function that evenly distributes the values, this keeps the expected chain length bounded, giving constant time lookups.\nThe hash tables used by hashmaps and hashsets are the same except they store different values. A hashset will contain references to a single value, and a hashmap will contain references to a key and a value.

Rather, the string 'I am studying word2vec' would typically just be preprocessed\/tokenized to a list of (unigram) tokens like ['I', 'am', 'studying', 'word2vec'].\nThe model will then learn one vector per single word – with no vectors for multigrams. And since it only knows such 1-word vectors, all the results its reports from .most_similar() will also be single words.\nYou can preprocess your text to combine some words into multiword entities, based on some sort of statistical or semantic understanding of the text. Very often, this process converts the runs-of-related-words to underscore-connected single tokens. For example, 'I visited New York City' might become ['I', 'visited', 'New_York_City'].\nBut any such preprocessing decisions are separate from the word2vec algorithm itself, which just considers whatever 'words' you feed it as 1:1 keys for looking-up vectors-in-training. It only knows tokens, not n-grams.\n    "}

I think it's more practical to put it this way: especially on a 64-bit machine with decent amounts of RAM and disk, upper bounds of long integers are way bigger than anything you'll ever compute.

Performance gets steadily worse when adding features with increasing percentages of NaN's. Features that have \"too many\" NaN's are completely ignored, even when the nan's indicate very useful information.\nThis is because the algorithm will never create a split on the decision \"isnan\" or \"ismissing\". The algorithm will ignore a feature at a particular level of the tree if that feature has a single NaN in that subset of samples. But, at lower levels of the tree, when sample sizes are smaller, it becomes more likely that a subset of samples won't have a NaN in a particular feature's values, and a split can occur on that feature.\nI have tried various imputation techniques to deal with the problem (replace with mean\/median, predict missing values using a different model, etc.), but the results were mixed.\nInstead, this is my solution: replace NaN's with a single, obviously out-of-range value (like -1.0). This enables the tree to split on the criteria \"unknown-value vs known-value\". However, there is a strange side-effect of using such out-of-range values: known values near the out-of-range value could get lumped together with the out-of-range value when the algorithm tries to find a good place to split. For example, known 0's could get lumped with the -1's used to replace the NaN's. So your model could change depending on if your out-of-range value is less than the minimum or if it's greater than the maximum (it could get lumped in with the minimum value or maximum value, respectively). This may or may not help the generalization of the technique, the outcome will depend on how similar in behavior minimum- or maximum-value samples are to NaN-value samples.\n    "}

The size of the images in the dataset could varry.\nCan a generlized code be written in python which could calculate flops automatically ? or is there any libraray avaialble.\nI am working with spyderAnaconda and the defined network is a sequential model.\nThank you.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>FLOPs are the floating-point operations performed by a model. It is usually calculated using the number of multiply-add operations that a model performs. Multiply-add operations, as the name suggests, are operations involving multiplication and addition of 2 or more variables. For example, the expression, a * b + c * d, has 2 flops while a * b + c * d + e * f + f * h has 4 flops.\nLet's now take a simple linear regression model for example. Assume this model has 4 parameters w1, w2, w3, and w4 and a bias b0. Inference on an input data, X = [x1, x2, x3, x4] results in output = x1 * h1 + x2 * h2 + x3 * h3 + x4 * h4 + b0. This operation has 4 flops\nThe FLOPs measurement in CNNs involves knowing the size of the input tensor, filters and output tensor for each layer. Using this information, flops are calculated for each layer and added together to obtain the total flops. Let's look at the first layer in VGG16 with input tensor of size 224x224x3, 64 filters of size 3x3x3 and output size of 224x224x64. Each element in the output results from an operation involving (3x3x3) multiply-add between the filter and the input tensor. Hence the number of flops for the first layer of VGG16 is (3x3x3)x(224x224x64)= 86,704,128\n    "}

I have another Mac with High Sierra (which uses MacOSX in the backend) and Matplotlib runs fine on it. I tried changing the backend on my iMac to MacOSX but that doesn't work. Any help will be really appreciated as I have already spend more than 3-4 hours (in vain!) to fix the problem\nIf I need to change the backend in matplotlibrc, could you advise what should I be using?\nthanks,\nPK\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>if you use virtualenv in Mojave, you have to install matplotliv (v1.3.1) at virtualenv. ** NOT VERSION 2.2.3 **. so, try the below command (btw, in your code, 'TkAgg' is needless):\n$pip install --no-cache-dir matplotlib==1.3.1\neverything will be fine.\n    "}

I do that over and over again, setting a particular attribute\n(1) always to the same value (so overall the value stored in the hdf5file does not change qualitatively)\n(2) always with a different value\nHow are these operations in terms of speed and memory? What I mean is the following, does setting the attribute really imply deletion of the attribute in the hdf5 file and adding a novel attribute with the same name as before? If so, does that mean every time I reset an existing attribute the size of the hdf5 file is slightly increased and keeps slowly growing until my hard disk is full?\nIf this is true, would it be more beneficial to check before I reset whether I have case (1) [and I should not store at all but compare data to the attribute written on disk] and only reassign if I face case (2) [i.e. the attribute value in the hdf5file is not the one I want to write to the hdf5 file].\nThanks a lot and best regards,\nRobert\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>HDF5 attribute access is notoriously slow.  HDF5 is really built for and around the array data structure.  Things like groups and attributes are great helpers but they are not optimized. \nThat said while attribute reading is slow, attribute writing is even slower.  Therefore, it is always worth the extra effort to do what you suggest.  Check if the attribute exists and if it has the desired value before writing it.  This should give you a speed boost as compared to just writing it out every time.  \nLuckily, the effect on memory of attributes -- both on disk and in memory -- is minimal.  This is because ALL attributes on a node fit into 64 kb of special metadata space.  If you try to write more than 64 kb worth of attributes, HDF5 and PyTables will fail.\nI hope this helps.\n    "}

My regular point of view is from a drone but I couldn't find any publicly available dataset from this point of view containing weapons. So, I collected images with weapons and tried to imitate as much as possible the drone point of view. \n\nOne of my first thought was to pad my images (to make smaller my actual bounding boxes inside them in respect with the image itself). \nA second though was to also rotate my images. Since tensorflow has not implemented this feature I made a simple code to create prerotated images. This has limitation but anyway I gave it a shot.\n\nI experimented with images of people at the beach and tried to imitate the actual problem: \n\nI am using relatively close images of people at the beach for training\nAnd at the same time using relatively distant images of people at the beach for testing purposes.\n\nThe actual problem\nAt one of my experiments I trained my model for longer than usual and noticed that it really blew it. To be more specific: \n\nI have an initial 140 \"close frame\" images for training. \nFrom them I had created 4x140=560 images with small padding (resulting image is up to 1.6 times the original in the biggest version) and rotation (up to 5 degrees rotation) resized version.\nI used this dataset of 560 images to train my model for almost 800k iterations using Faster R-CNN model.\nI exported the model in various iterations:\nAt 150k, 300k, 500k, 700k and used to test it on my test images.\n\nI have also used for comparison models which was trained with the original resized images to check the differences.\nUn-expected results\n\nThe first peculiar observation is that my model at 500k and above it does not detect any person at all. (First thought was overtraining)\nI tried it on the actual training images to check this and here also did not detect anything at my testing images. \nAlso, I would expect my \"enhanced\" dataset to perform better than the simply resized one but this does not seem the case also. (This though is a minor problem which seem scientifically rational).\n\nSo, my question is how is that even possible? Training for too long can lead to being unable to detect training samples also? Is there any theoretical explanation for this? (Apart from errors in implementation etc which I think is not really probable but cannot be excluded in any case).\nP.S.1\nMy resized version of the image follows the same resize conditions of Faster R-CNN with min. dim. being 600 pixels and max. one 1024 pixels. So, this should not be any resizing problem.\nP.S.2\nI am using tensorflow but I don't think this is tensorflow specific issue. So, I did not include it in tags.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>After some research (and a lot of experiments) I have come to some conclusions which might help others facing the same problem.\n\nFailing to detect any object probably means that the model has collapsed in some part of training. A possible indication of this in my case was some extremely high values of loss values when training. While I have models that this happened and does not seem to affect the model too much (at least not too much to make it useless) an increasing amount of these values is a good sign that something is fatally wrong. Notice that the frequency of appearance of these values is not necessarily increasing all the time.\nMore classes the better: After the first period I was conducting my experiments with just 1 class. While this is legitimate and nothing has been mentioned (to my knowledge) about avoiding it (I even read tutorials using 1 class object detection) this also intensified the crack rate. Using 2 classes seems to partially alleviate the problem. When I trained my model with 11 classes the problem seems to vanish.\nSmall variation in bbox's sizes helps: Experimenting with bounding boxes varying a lot in size I came to the conclusion that largely homogeneous bbox's sizes help to also alleviate the issue.\nMore classes may increase performance: I have noticed also that while 11 classes problem seem quite heavier task than 1 class due to the limitations in training the model with 1 class performance is some cases was higher in the former case.\n\nMy final conclusion is that my model for some reason was experiencing at some point an overflow on some weights that prevent it from returning to the normal again. The fact that I have augmented my data (maybe similar images were fed one after the other and intensified certain weights for example) maybe increased the frequency of the problem occurrence but the problem was still present in non-augmented dataset.\n    "}

First convert the image into strings, then train the neural network with sample real texts, then let the trained model find corresponding texts in texts converted from images.\n\nSo, my questions are listed below:\n\nCan this problem be solved without training a neural network? Will it be more efficient than NN, in terms of time taken to run the program and accuracy of results?\nAmong the two methods above I wrote, which one is better, in terms of time taken to run the program and accuracy of results?\nAny other experienced suggestions?\n\n\nAdditional background information if needed:\nSo, I have a number of groups of screenshots of different web pages, each of which has a lot of texts on it. And I want to extract certain paragraphs from that large volume of texts. The paragraphs I want to extract express similar things but under different contexts.\nFor example, on a large mixed online forum platform, many comments are made on different things, some on landscapes of mountains, some politics, some sciences, etc... As that platform cannot only have one page, there must be hundreds of pages where countless of users make their comments. Now I want to extract the comments on politics specifically from the entire forum, i.e. from all the pages that platform has. So I would use Python + Selenium to scrape the pages and save the screenshots. Now we need to go back to the questions asked above. What to do now? \n\nUpdate:\nJust a thought went by. Probably a NN trained by images that contain texts cannot give a very accurate location of wanted texts, as the NN might be only looking for arrangements of pixels instead of the words, or even meaning, that compose the sentences or paragraphs. So maybe the second method, text processing, may be better in this case? (like NLP?)\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>So, you decided not to parse text, but save it as an image and then detect text from this image.  \nText -> Image -> Text\nIt is worst scenario for parsing webpages.  \nWhile dealing with OCR you must expect many problems, such as:\n\nHigh CPU consumption;\nDifferent fonts;\nHidden elements (like 'See full text');\nAnd the main one - you can't OCR with 100% accuracy. \n\nIf you try to create common parser, that should crawl only required text from any page given without any \"garbage\" - it is almost utopic idea.\nAs far as i know, something about this is 'HTML Readability' technology (Browsers like Safari and Firefox uses it). But how it will work with forums i can't say. Forums is very special format of pages.\n    "}

Number of edges - it can be assumed that maximum would be 10% of complete graph (usually less) so it gives in that case maximum number of n*(n-1)\/10\nThere is an algorithm that can generate from input graph G sub-graphs in number of hundreds\/thousands. And for each sub-graph are made some (time consuming) computations.\nPair \"subgraph, computation results\" must be stored for later use (dynamic programming approach - if given sub-graph were already processed we want to re-use its results).\nBecause of point (2.) it would be really nice to store sub-graph\/results pairs in kind of dictionary where sub-graph is a key. How it can be done efficiently? Some ideas of efficient calculation of sub-graph hash value maybe?\nLet's assume that memory is not a problem and I can find machine with enough memory to keep a data - so let's focus only on speed.\n\nOf course If there are already nice to use data-structures that might be helpful in this problem (like sparse matrices from scipy) they are very welcome.\nI just would like to know your opinions about it and maybe some hints regarding approach to this problem.\nI know that there are nice graph\/network libraries for Python like NetworkX, igraph, graph-tool which have very efficient algorithms to process provided graph. But seems (or I could not find) efficient way to fulfill points (2. 3.)\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The key point here is the data format of the graphs already generated by your algorithm. Does it contruct a new graph by adding vertices and edges ? Is it rewritable ? Does it uses a given format (matrix, adjacency list, vertices and nodes sets etc.)\nIf you have the choice however, because your subgraph have a \"low\" cardinality and because space is not an issue, I would store subgraphs as arrays of bitmasks (the bitmask part is optional, but it is hashable and makes a compact set). A subgraph representation would be then \n\nL a list of node references in your global graph G. It can also be a bitmask to be used as a hash\nA an array of bitmask (matrix) where A[i][j] is the truth value of the edge L[i] -> L[j]\n\nThis takes advantage of the infinite size low space requirement of Python integers. The space complexity is O(n*n) but you get efficient traversal and can easily hash your structure.\n    "}

There's a bunch of such modified optimizers like Adam or RMSProp. Experiment with them to see what works best. Adam is probably going to give you the best performance.\nYou can add an extra label no_class, so your task will now be a 6+1 label classification.

{"text":"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n    Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\n    Today Date: 1 January 2025\n\n    You are a helpful ML assistant\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I'm toying with a problem modelled by a linear system, which can be written as a square block-tridiagonal matrix. These blocks are of size b = 4n+8, and the full matrix is of size Nb; N could be arbitrarily large (reasonably, of course) while n is kept rather small (typically less than 10).\nThe blocks themselves are sparse, the first diagonal being only identity matrices, and the second diagonals having only n+1 non-zero columns (so 3n+7 columns of zeroes) per block. These columns are contiguous, either zeroes then non-zeroes or the other way around.\nBuilding all these blocks in memory results in a 3N-2 x b x b array that can be turned into a sparse matrix with scipy.sparse.bsr_matrix, then cast to CSR format and trimmed of the excess zeroes. It works nicely but I'd rather skip this temporary large and sparse array (for N = 1e4, n = 5 it's 5.6 zeros for every relevant entry!) altogether.\n\nI had a look at scipy.sparse.dok_matrix, recommended for slicing and incremental building. Creating my entries fits in a tidy loop but the process is ~10 times longer than using bsr_matrix with my unnecessary dense array, which will be detrimental to the future use cases.\nIt doesn't seem like bsr_matrix can be used directly with scipy sparse matrices as input.\nUsing bsr_matrix without including the diagonal blocks, then adding a sparse eye greatly reduces the number of zeros (3.5 per relevant entry in my test configuration) and speeds up the process by a third compared to the original solution. Score!\n\nAny clue on things that I could do to further reduce the original imprint of this matrix? The obvious goal being to give me more freedom with the choice of N.\nEDIT\nI managed to improved things a tad more by constructing the three block-diagonals separately. By doing so, I need less padding for my 2nd diagonals (n+3 instead of 3n+7; 1.3 zeroes per relevant entry), dividing my original blocks into two vertical blocks (one full of zeroes) and I only need it one diagonal at a time, cutting the memory cost in half on top of that. The main diagonal remains constructed with the eye method. The icing on the cake: a speed up of 25% compared to my 3rd bullet point, probably because separating the two 2nd diagonals saves some array reshaping operations needed before using bsr_matrix. Compared to the original method, for my (N, n) = (1e4, 5) test case it's ~20M zeroes saved when comparing matrices before trimming. At 128 bits each, it's a decent gain already!\nThe only possible improvement that I can picture now is building these diagonals separately, without any padding, then inserting columns of zeros (probably via  products with block-matrices of identities) and finally adding everything together.\nI also read something about using a dict to update an empty dok_matrix, but in my case I think I would need to expand lists of indices, take their Cartesian product to construct the keys and each element of my blocks would need to be an individual value as one apparently cannot use slices as dictionary keys.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I ended up implementing the solution I proposed in my last paragraph.\nFor each 2nd diagonal, I construct a block sparse matrix without any padding, then I transform it into a matrix of the proper shape by a right-hand side product with a block matrix whose blocks are identity. I do need to store zeroes here to use bsr_matrix (I first gave a try to the method scipy.sparse.block_diag, but it was extremely slow), but less of them compared to my semi-padding solution: (4n+7)(n+1) vs (4n+8)(n+3); and they can be represented with 8 bits instead of 128. Execution time is increased by ~40% but I can live with that (and it's still a decrease of 20% compared to the first solution).\nI might be missing something here, but for now I'm pretty satisfied with this solution.\nEDIT\nWhen trimming the zeroes of the RHS matrices before effecting the product, the execution time is reduced by 30% compared to the previously most efficient solution; all's well that ends well.\n    "}

Point (a) is - of course - required for any form of calibration. Point (b) allows one to build a table of calibration parameters keyed on the focus setting.  I have seen this done in some applications where dynamical focusing was an unavoidable requirement, but the necessary gear tends to be very expensive and fragile.\n    "}

Those vectors are different not only in their measurements but also in number of n and the sum A = a1 + a2 + a3 +...+ an.\nMost of the vectors have 5-6 dimensions, with some exception at 15-20 dimensions. On average, their components often have value of 40-50.\nI have tried Kmeans, DBSCAN and GMM to cluster them:\n\nKmeans overall gives the best result, however, for vectors with 2-3 dimensions and vectors with low A, it often misclassifies.\nDBSCAN can only separate vector with low dimension and low A from the dataset, the rest it treats as noise.\nGMM separates the vectors with 5-10 dimension, low A, very good, but performs poorly on the rest.\n\nNow I want to include the information of n and A into the process. Example:\n-Vector 1 [0,1,2,1,0] and Vector 2 [0,2,4,5,3,2,1,0], they are differents in both n and A, they can't be in the same cluster.

Maybe you had them automatically filled up with 0 values - and that is likely why the long vectors end up being very far away from all others.\nDon't use the algorithms as black boxes\nYou need to understand what they are doing or the result will likely be useless. In your case, they are using a bad distance, so of course the result can't be very good.\nSo first, you'll need to find a better way of computing the distance of two points with different length. How similar should [0,1,2,1,0] and [30,40,50,60,50,40,30] be. To me, this is a highly similar pattern (ramp up, ramp down).\n    "}

My original design was to run the full-length Kruskal algorithm of the input and produce an MST, after which delete the last k-1 edges (or equivalently k-1 most expensive edges).\nOf course this is the same as running Kruskal algorithm and stopping it just before it adds its last k-1 edges.\nI want to use the second strategy i.e instead of running the full length Kruskal algorithm, stop it just after the number of clusters so far equals K. I'm using Union-Find data structure and using a list object in this Union-Find data structure.\nEach vertex on this graph is represented by its current cluster on this list e.g [1,2,3...] means vertices 1,2,3 are in their distinct independent clusters. If two vertices are joined  their corresponding indices on the list data structure are updated to reflect this.\ne.g merging vertices 2 and 3 leaves the list data object as [1,2,2,4,5.....]\nMy strategy is then every time two nodes are merged, count the number of DISTINCT elements in the list and if it equals the number of desired clusters, stop.

Is there a way I could count the number of distinct objects in a list efficiently?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One way is to sort your list and then run over the elements by comparing each one to the previous one. If they are not equal sum 1 to your \"distinct counter\". This operation is O(n), and for sorting you can use the sorting algorithm you prefer, such as quick sort or merge sort, but I guess there is an available sorting algorithm in the lib you use.\nAnother option is to create a hash table and add all the elements. The number of insertions will be the distinct elements, since repeated elements will not be inserted. I think this is O(1) in the best case so maybe this is the better solution. Good luck!\nHope this helps,\nDídac Pérez\n    "}

Residual layers are said to help improving performance in multiple ways: They let the gradient flow better, they might help in localization etc.  My guess is that some of these advantages like gradient flow, hold also for networks consisting of fully connected layers.\nOther ideas like saying we learn residuals F(X)-X, where F is a residual block are more questionable due to absence of spatial correlation. That is, for CNNs, where residual connections are mostly used, we have some form of locality, that is if you have the feature map X of some layer (you can also think of X as the input) and the output of a residual block F(X) then both X and F(X) correlate. That is, oftentimes the map at location X[i,j] is similar to that of F(X)[i,j]. This does not hold for fully connected networks, since neurons do not contain spatial information.

This allow to swap the device between CPU and GPU.\nBut you can pickle Theano functions. If you do that, pickle all associated function at the same time. Otherwise, they will have each of them a different copy of the shared variable. Each call to load() will create new shared variable if they where pickled. This is a limitation of pickle.\n    "}

If so, why?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Contrary to the most often used KFold cross validation strategy, the Shuffle Split uses random samples of elements in each iteration. For a working example, let's consider a simple training dataset with 10 observations;\nTraining data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]\n\nKFold (k=5)\n\n\nShuffle the data, imagine it is now [6,9,1,4,10,5,7,2,3,8]\nCreate folds; Fold 1 = [6,9], Fold 2 = [1,4], Fold 3 = [10,5], Fold 4 =\n[7,2] and Fold 5 = [3,8]\nTrain keeping one fold aside each iteration for evaluation and using all others\n\n\nShuffle split (n_iter=3, test_size=0.2)\n\nIt works iterative manner where you specify number of iterations (default n_iter=10 in sklearn)\n\nEach iteration shuffle the data; [6,9,1,4,10,3,8,2,5,7], [6,2,1,4,10,7,5,9,3,8] and [2,6,1,4,10,5,7,9,3,8]\nSplit into specified train and evaluation dataset as chosen with the hyper-parameter (test_size); Training data are [6,9,1,4,10,3,8,2], [6,2,1,4,10,7,5,9] and [2,6,1,4,10,5,7,9] respectively. Test data are [5,7], [3,8] and [3,8] respectively.\n\nAs you can notice, although the shuffle is different (technically it can be same), the training and testing data for the last two iteration are exactly same. As the number of iterations increase, your chance of fitting the same dataset increases which is counter-intuitive to the cross-validation idea where we would like get an estimate of generalizability of our model with limited amount of data. On the other hand, the datasets usually contains numerous observations so that having the same (or very similar) training and test datasets is not an issue. Keeping number of iterations high enough improves the generalizability of your results.\n    "}

It seems to be step 4 that's taking up most of the time.  For the most part, I'd like to optimize this for handling a set of records in the low millions running on a quad-core server with a RAID setup of some kind.\nThere are a few ideas that I have to solve this:\n\nRead the entire file from step one (or at least read it in very large chunks) and write the file to disk as a whole or in very large chunks.  The idea being that the hard disk would spend less time going back and forth between files.  Would this do anything that buffering wouldn't?\nParallelize steps 1, 2&3, and 4 into separate processes.  This would make steps 1, 2, and 3 not have to wait on 4 to complete.\nBreak the load file up into separate chunks and process them in parallel.  The rows don't need to be handled in any sequential order.  This would likely need to be combined with step 2 somehow.\n\nOf course, the correct answer to this question is \"do what you find to be the fastest by testing.\"  However, I'm mainly trying to get an idea of where I should spend my time first.  Does anyone with more experience in these matters have any advice?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Python already does IO buffering and the OS should handle both prefetching the input file and delaying writes until it needs the RAM for something else or just gets uneasy about having dirty data in RAM for too long.  Unless you force the OS to write them immediately, like closing the file after each write or opening the file in O_SYNC mode.\nIf the OS isn't doing the right thing, you can try raising the buffer size (third parameter to open()). For some guidance on appropriate values given a 100MB\/s 10ms latency IO system a 1MB IO size will result in approximately 50% latency overhead, while a 10MB IO size will result in 9% overhead. If its still IO bound, you probably just need more bandwidth. Use your OS specific tools to check what kind of bandwidth you are getting to\/from the disks.\nAlso useful is to check if step 4 is taking a lot of time executing or waiting on IO. If it's executing you'll need to spend more time checking which part is the culprit and optimize that, or split out the work to different processes.\n    "}

Do you have the names of the players or some skill set?\nNeural networks or any AI algorithm work with numbers. They do not know anything about the real world such as day name(Monday, Tuesday etc.) or Country names. What you have to do is you have to create a mapping between these real-world issues and numbers.\nThey are something categorical(it can not take a continuous value) you can map the days from 0 to N. For the countries you can do the same, every country can have a unique ID. You have to be careful tough if, during inference the model receives a day or country that was not extant in the training, it will be unknown to the model. So either adds all the countries that are relevant or if you can not know this in prior, you can add a label -1 for the case of unknown country and day.\nFor each feature, you will have a column and each row represents a match. In the column, you will have to correspondings IDs for that particular feature and match and you can pass this data to AI. By the way, it is okay that you use the same IDs\/numbers for different features. (So you can you 1 for Tuesday and in the other Column 1 can be Switzerland)\nAnswers to your questions:\n\nYes, in theory, this can happen. If you have enough samples and a good model the model itself might learn it.\n\nIf you can do, you can input relative values to the model instead of absolute values. So for example, if you have some skill set attributes\/scores with respect to players, instead of feeding both scores to the system, you can create your data based on the difference of these score. E.g shooting for player1 is 80 and for player2 78. You have a column for shooting and there you put the value 80-78, then the modal knows the player1 is better by 2 or if vice versa you could put -2 and thne th emodel knows the player2 is better by 2 in that category. Another approach would be to have each match 2 times in the training data. The second one with player orders reversed. The model might also learn this from the data.\n\nThat is easy to do, your model will output not players IDs or anything related to the player. Your problem is a binary classification problem. Your model should output in any case either 0 or 1. 0 meaning player1 wins, 1 meaning player2 wins and then you can convert this output to the players by yourself.\n    "}

Please specify computation complexity of suggested method. My project is implemented in Python. Please help. Thanks in advance.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>One approach would be to choose a threshold density, convert all voxels below this threshold to 0 and all above it to 1, and then look for the pair of 1-voxels whose shortest path is longest among all pairs of 1-voxels.  These two voxels should be near the ends of the longest \"rope\", regardless of the exact shape that rope takes.\nYou can define a graph where there is a vertex for each 1-voxel and an edge between each 1-voxel and its 6 (or possibly 14) neighbours.  You can then compute the lengths of the shortest paths between some given vertex u and every other vertex in O(|V|) time and space using breadth first search (we don't need Dijkstra or Floyd-Warshall here since every edge has weight 1).  Repeating this for each possible start vertex u gives an O(|V|^2)-time algorithm.  As you do this, keep track of the furthest pair so far.\nIf your voxel space has w*h*d cells, there could be w*h*d vertices in the graph (if every single voxel is a 1-voxel), so this could take O(w^2*h^2*d^2) time in the worst case, which is probably quite a lot.  Luckily there are many ways to speed this up if you can afford a slightly imprecise answer:\n\nOnly compute shortest paths from start vertices that are at the boundary -- i.e. those vertices that have fewer than 6 (or 14) neighbours.  (I believe this won't sacrifice an optimal solution.)\nAlternatively, first \"skeletonise\" the graph by repeatedly getting rid of all such boundary vertices whose removal will not disconnect the graph.\nA good order for choosing starting vertices is to first choose any vertex, and then always choose a vertex that was found to be at maximum possible distance from the last one (and which has not yet been tried, of course).  This should get you a very good approximation to the longest shortest path after just 3 iterations: the furthest vertex from the start vertex will be near one of the two rope ends, and the furthest vertex from that vertex will be near the other end!\n\nNote: If there is no full-voxel gap between distant points on the rope that are near each other due to bending, then the shortest paths will \"short-circuit\" through these false connections and possibly reduce the accuracy.  You might be able to ameliorate this by increasing the threshold.  OTOH, if the threshold is too high then the rope can become disconnected.  I expect you want to choose the highest threshold that results in only 1 connected component.\n    "}

If there is a file named config_custom.csv in the same directory as converter.py, then the custom configuration will be used. If there is no custom CSV config file, then there is a default configuration built into converter.py.\nI wrote a unit test using unittest from the Python 2.7 standard library to validate this behavior. The unit test in setUp() would rename config_custom.csv to wrong_name.csv, then it would run the tests (hopefully using the default config), then in tearDown() it would rename the file back the way it should be.\nProblem: Python unit tests run in parallel, and I got terrible race conditions. The file config_custom.csv would get renamed in the middle of other unit tests in a non-deterministic way. It would cause at least one error or failure about 90% of the time that I ran the entire test suite.\nThe ideal solution would be to tell unittest: Do NOT run this test in parallel with other tests, this test is special and needs complete isolation.\nMy work-around is to add an optional argument to the function that searches for config files.

As @barny wrote, you can see the IDs of different resources when you open the interactive nltk.download() window. \n\nTo use the treebank pos tagger, you need its pickled training tables (not the treebank corpus); you'll find them in the \"Models\" tab under the ID maxent_treebank_pos_tagger. (Hence: nltk.download(\"maxent_treebank_pos_tagger\").\nThe FreqDist class doesn't have or need any trained model. \nNeither does word_tokenize, which takes a sentence as a single string and breaks it up into words.

That's handled by the \"Punkt\" sentence tokenizer, and you can download its model with nltk.download(\"punkt\").\n\nPS.

I created a dtype definition and provided the maximum string sizes.\nHowever, now when I am trying to download data directly from Oracle DB and post it to HDF5 file via pandas.HDFStore, I run into some problems.\npandas.io.sql.read_frame does not support chunked reading.

If you allow 4k for every unique key (conservative estimate, includes overhead etc), and you don't keep the timestamps, so it's just an array of integers, it might use up about 1.1GB of RAM for 3 million records. That's not a whole heap, and presumably you only want a small window of active data, or perhaps you are processing row by row?\nMake a generator function to do all of this. That way, once you complete iteration it should free up the memory, without having to del anything, and it also makes your code easier to follow and avoids bloating the actual important logic of your calculation loop.\nIf you can't store it all in memory, or for some other reason this doesn't work, then the best thing you can do, is work out how much you can store in memory. You can potentially split the job into multiple requests, and use multithreading to send a request once the last one has finished, while you process the data into your new file. It shouldn't use up memory, until you ask for the data to be returned. Try and work out if the delay is the request being fulfilled, or the data being downloaded.\nFrom the sounds of it, you might be abstracting the database, and letting pandas make the requests. It might be worth looking at how it's limiting the results. You should be able to make the request for all the data, but only load the results one row at a time from the database server.\n    "}

You can initialize your array with zeros (using states = np.zeros((N,3))) and fill the values as you go, associating the index i to the time t[i] = t0 +i*h. This would be inside the loop: \nstates[:,i+1] = states[:,i] + RK4_step(states[:,i]),\nwhere RK4_step(states[:,i]) is a function returning an array (column) with your variation of the state values in one step of the Runge-Kutta method.\nEven if your time-step is variable you should still do that, but with nonuniform times t[i] = t0 +i*h. \nOr, you could use numpy.integrate.ode_int(), which returns the solution of an ODE at the required times.\n    "}

The initial idea was somewhat akin to 20 questions: We ask the user certain questions, such as \"Do you like museums?\", \"Do you like architecture\", \"Do you like nightlife\" etc., and then based on these answers decide for the user their best vacation destination. We answer these questions based on keywords scraped from websites, and the decision tree we would implement would allow us to effectively determine the next question to ask a user. However, we are having some difficulties with the implementation. Some examples of our difficulties are as follows:\nThere are issues with granularity of questions. For example, to say that a city is good for \"nature-lovers\" is great, but this does not mean much. Nature could involve say, hot, sunny and wet vacations for some, whereas for others, nature could involve a brisk hike in cool woods. Fortunately, the API we are currently using provides us with a list of attractions in a city, down to a fairly granular level (for example, it distinguishes between different watersport activities such as jet skiing, or white water rafting). My question is: do we need to create some sort of hiearchy like:\n\nnature-> (Ocean,Mountain,Plains) (Mountain->Hiking,Skiing,...)\n\nor would it be best to simply include the bottom level results (the activities themselves) and just ask questions regarding those?

Then run it on your test data again and see how it does.  Look up \"transfer learning\"...and a \"finetuning example\" for your toolkit.(Note that for finetuning you need to mod the output layer of the net)\nI'm not sure how big your original source images are but you can resize them and throw a pre-trained cifar100 net at it(finetuned) or even an imagenet if the source images are big enough. Hmmm cifar\/imagnet are for colour images...but you could replicate your greyscale to each rgb band for fun.\nMark my words...these steps may \"seem simple\"...but if you can work through it and get some results(even if they're not great results) by finetuning with your own data, you can consider yourself a decent NN technician.  \nOne good tutorial for finetuning is on the Caffe website...flickr style(I think)...there's gotta be one for TF too.\nThe last step is to design your own CNN...be careful when changing filter sizes--you need to understand how it affects outputs of each layer and how information is preserved\/lost.\nI suppose another thing to do is to do \"data augmentation\" to get yourself some more of it.  slight rotations\/resizing\/lighting...etc.  Tf has some nice preprocessing for doing some of this...but some will need to be done by yourself.\ngood luck!\n    "}

It's typically easier to fix overfitting than underfitting so that helps, too.\nTry looking at your tree outputs. If you are using python, sci-kit learn's export_graphviz can be helpful. \nTry reducing the maximum depth of the trees. \nTry increasing the maximum number of a samples a tree must have in order to split (or similarly, the minimum number of samples a leaf should have). \nTry increasing the number of trees in the RF.\n\nUnderfitting on linear regression\n\nAdd more parameters. If you have variables a, b, ... etc. adding their polynomial features, i.e. a^2, a^3 ... b^2, b^3 ... etc. may help. If you add enough polynomial features you should be able to overfit -- although that doesn't necessarily mean it will have a good fit on the train set (RMSE value).\nTry plotting some of the variables against the value to predict (y). Perhaps you may be able to see a non-linear pattern (i.e. a logarithmic relationship).  \nDo you know anything about the data? Perhaps a variable that is the multiple, or the division between two variables may be a good indicator. \nIf you are regularizing (or if the software is automatically applying) your regression, try reducing the regularization parameter.\n    "}

One can exploit QR-factorization, but it is not necessarily preserves sparsity.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>As a preliminary thought you could partition the matrix into diagonal blocks, fill those blocks with QR and then permute rows\/columns. The resulting matrices will remain orthagonal. Alternatively, you could define some sparsity pattern for Q and try to minimize f(Q, xi)  subject to QQ^T=I  where f is some (preferably) convex function that adds entropy through the random variable xi. Can't say anything about the efficacy of either method since I haven't actually tried them.\nEDIT: A bit more about the second method. f can really be any function. One choice might be similarity of the non-zero elements to a random gaussian vector (or any other random variate): f = ||vec(Q) - x||_2^2, x ~ N(0, sigma * I). You could handle this using any general constrained optimizer. The problem of course, is that not every pattern S is guaranteed to have a (full rank) orthogonal filling. If you have the memory, L1 regularization (or a smooth approximation) could encourage sparsity in a dense matrix variable: g(Q) = f(Q) + P(Q) where P is any sparsity-inducing penalty function. Check out Wen & Yen (2010) \"A feasible Method for Optimization with Orthogonality Constraints\" for an algorithm specifically designed for optimization of general (differentiable) functions over (dense) orthogonal matrices and Liu, Wu, So (2015) \"Quadratic Optimization with Orthogonality Constraints\" for more theorical evaluation of several line\/arc search algorithms for quadratic functions. If memory is a problem, you could generate each row\/column separately using sparse basis pursuit, for which there are many algorithms depending on the nature of your problem.

For 1-dimensional trees you have red-black-trees, B-trees, B*-trees, B+-trees and such things. These don't obviously work with k-d-trees because of the rotating axes and thus different sorting. So in the end, with a k-d-tree, it may be best to just collect changes, and from time to time do a full tree rebuild. Then at least this part of the tree will be quite good.\nHowever, there exists a similar structure (that in my experiments often outperforms the k-d-tree!): the R*-tree. Instead of performing binary splits, it uses rectangular bounding boxes to collect objects, and a lot of thought was put into making the tree a dynamic data structure. This is also where the R*-tree performs much better than the R-tree: it has a much more clever split for kNN search, and it performs incremental rebalancing to improve its structure.\n    "}

I've not implemented an interpolation motor beyond 3rd order, but I suppose the 4th and 5th order splines will require at least the 3rd and 4th derivatives.\nRather than recalculating these derivatives every time you want to perform an interpolation, it is best to calculate them just once. My guess is that spline_filter is doing this pre-calculation of the derivatives which then get used later for the interpolation calculations.\n    "}

Eventually, when I try to check the dimension of my array X, it becomes: X.shape, outputs (81,).  The number 81 is what I expected, but I also expect the 2nd dimension is 1, rather than just omitted. This makes me feel very uncomfortable even though when I directly type X, it output correctly, i.e., one column and the figures in X are all as expected. \nThen when I use another array Y, which literally has Y.shape, outputs (81,1), then if I type X*Y, which I expected to see one array of dimension (81,1) but instead, I saw an array of dimension (81,81).\nI don't know what is the underlying mechanism to produce this results. \nThe way I solve this problem is very stupid. I first create a new array C = zeros((81,1)), so C literally has dimension (81,1), then I assign my X to C by typing C[:,0]=X, then C.shape = (81,1). Note that if I type C=X, then C.shape=(81,), which goes back to my problem.

Therefore\n\nIf you write C[: 0] = X, you are assigning a column to one of the columns of C (which happens to be the only one), and therefore are not changing the dimension of C.\nIf you write C = X, then you are saying that C is now a column as well, and therefore are changing the dimension of C.\n    "}

That means Ts should be about the expected size of the initial changes in the cost function, and Tf small enough that no more changes are expected. \nIn Corana's paper, there are many hyperparameters listed that make sense: N_s is the number of evaluation cycles before changing step sizes, N_T are the number of step-size changes before changing the temperature, and r_T is the factor by which the temp is reduced each time. However, I can't figure out how these correlate to pygmo's parameters of n_T_adj, n_range_adj, bin_size, and start_range.\nI'm really curious if anyone can explain how pygmo's hyperparameters are used, and how they relate to the original paper by Corana et al?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Gonna answer my own question here. I climbed into the actual .cpp code and found the answers.\nIn Corana's method, you select how many total iterations N of annealing you want. Then the minimization is a nested series of loops where you vary the step sizes, number of step-size adjustments, and temperature values at user-defined intervals. In PAGMO, they changed this so you explicitly specify how many times you will do these. Those are the n_* parameters and bin_size. I don't think bin_size is a good name here, because it isn't actually a size. It is the number of steps taken through a bin range, such that N=n_T_adj * n_range_adj * bin_range. I think just calling it n_bins or n_bins_adj makes more sense. Every bin_size function evaluations, the stepsize is modified (see below for limits). \nIn Corana's method you specify the multiplicative factor to decrease the temperature each time it is needed; it could be that you reach the minimum temp before running out of iterations, or vice versa. In PAGMO, the algorithm automatically computes the temperature-change factor so that you reach Tf at the end of the iteration sequence: r_t=(Tf\/Ts)**(1\/n_T_adj). \nThe start_range is, I think, a bad name for this variable. The stepsize in the alorithm is a fraction between 0 and start_range which defines the width of the search bins between the upper and lower bounds for each variable. So if stepsize=0.5, width=0.5*(upper_bound-lower_bound). At each iteration, the step size is adjusted based on how many function calls were accepted. If the step size grows larger than start_range, it is reset to that value. I think I would call it step_limit instead. But there you go.\n    "}

However, there are results where are get the same word and its plurial or adverb or so. To go around this problem, I decided to use stemming, but this leads to a problem where words and their antonyms can have the same root or by reducing a word to its root does not enable to go back and find that specific word in the document if a user was to search for it. Is there a nlp that might be better in this context than nlp? Any hint or link will be useful. I working on something that is very similar to youtube.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First you'd want to make a choice between Stems and Lemmas (neither are Roots, mind you). Google the difference for more on that. \nYou mention antonyms, but most are determined by prefix (e.g. important vs (un)important). So the Stemmer should leave most antonyms unchanged. \nAs for synonyms, let's assume you're thinking only about words with the exact same Stem, because if you want to relate synonyms with completely unrelated roots, you'd be thinking about semantics and something like wordnet but that would likely complicate your problem beyond reasonable...\nFrom your question, you already have a Stemmer working in Python...The simplest solution would be using two dictionaries: One dictionary mapping stems\/lemmas to the set\/list of inflected\/derived complete words (and\/or their frequency). And a second dictionary mapping those complete words to their various positions in the documents you are indexing.\nThat way you can stem the user input word, check for it in the top-k tf-idf\/stem dictionary, and afterwards map the complete word with the second dictionary to its occurrences in the document set.\n(It's hard to elaborate further given your question.)\n    "}

I want to click on one point and change the colour \/ alpha of the unselected glyphs such that each unselected glyph has a custom colour based on it's relationship with the selected point. \nFor example, I'd want the closest points to the selected point to have alpha near to 1 and the furthest to have alpha near to 0.\nI've seen other questions where the unselected glyphs have different alphas, but the alphas are independent of what is selected. Is it possible to do this without using JavaScript?\nEdited for more details:\nThe specific dataset I'm working on is a dataset of a bike sharing system, with data on trips made between specific stations. When I click on a specific station, I want to show the destination stations to which users go to when they start from the station selected. For n stations, the data thus has a n * n format: for each station, we have the probability of going to every other station. Ideally, this probability will be the alpha of the unselected stations, such the most popular destinations would have alpha near to 1, and the less popular ones an alpha near to 0.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>In order to avoid tripling (or quintupling) memory usage in the browser, Bokeh only supports setting \"single values\" for non-selection colors and alphas. That is, non-selection properties can't be vectorized by pointing them at a ColumnDataSource column. So there's only two options I can think of:\n\nSplit the glyphs into different groups of glyphs, that each have a different different nonselection_color. This might be feasible if you only have a few groups. Of course now you have to partition your data to have e.g. five calls to p.circle instead of one, but it would entirely avoid JS. \nUse a tiny amount of JavaScript in a CustomJS callback. You can have an additional column in the CDS that provides the non-selected colors. When a selection happens, the CustomJS callback switches the glyph's normal color field to point to the other column and when a selection is cleared, changes it back to the \"normal\" field.\n    "}

To do that, consider the biggest GDP is GDPmax and the minimum GDP is GDPmin. Then, map each GDPi to\nscaleGDPi = [(GDPi - GDPmin) * (1 - 2 * delta)\/(GDPmax-GDPmin)] + delta.\nIn a similar way, also scale the consumation to be in [delta, 1 - delta].\nThen, consider xi = scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi * x and you get (city beer)i = scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi * x * national beer\nBy imposing that the sum of city beer is equal to national beer, you get:\nx = 1 \/ (sum scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi).\nSo, city beer = (scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi * national beer)\/(sum scaleGDPi * scaleConsumationi).\nI think this would be a more adequate modelization of your problem.\n    "}

Using list comprehension is taking too much time, and I needed an alternative (you cannot import modules so numpy isn't an option). I had initially done this:\ngrid = [[[0,0] for i in range(2500)] for i in range(2500)]\nbut it was taking far too much time, so I tried:\n grid= [[[0,0]]*2500]*2500,\nwhich gives the same result initially, but whenever I try to change a value, for example:\ngrid[50][120][0]= 1, it changes the 0th index position of every [0,0] to False in the entire matrix instead of the specific coordinate at the [50][120] position, and this isn't the case when I use list comprehension. Does anybody know what's happening here? And any solution that doesn't involve a crazy run time? I started python just a couple of months before competitive programming so I'm not super experienced.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>grid = [[[0,0] for i in range(2500)] for i in range(2500)]\ntakes around 2.1 seconds on my PC, timing with PowerShell's Measure-Command. Now if the data specifications are strict, there is no magical way to make this faster. However, if the goal is to make this representation generate faster there is a better solution: use tuple instead of list for the inner data (0, 0).\ngrid = [[(0, 0) for i in range(2500)] for i in range(2500)]\nThis snippet generates the same informational value in under quarter of the time (0.48 s). Now what you have to consider here is what comes next. When updating these values in the grid, you need to always create a new tuple to replace the old one - which will always be slower than just updating the list value in the original sample code. This is because tuple doesn't support item assignment operation. Replacing a single value is still as easy as grid[50][120] = (1, grid[50][120][1]).\nFast generation - slow replacement, might be handy if there aren't tons of value changes. Hope this helps.\n    "}

Certainly, such solutions bear two main risks:\n\nover-fitting to the portion of the text reviewed\/considered in building the rules\npossible messiness\/complexity of the solution if too many rules and sub-rules are introduced.\n\nRunning some plain statical analysis on the complete (or very big sample) of the texts to be considered should help guide the selection of a few heuristics and also avoid the over-fitting concerns.  I'm quite sure that a relatively small number of rules, associated with a custom dictionary should be sufficient to produce a classifier with appropriate precision as well as speed\/resources performance.\nA few ideas:\n\ncount all the words (and possibly all the bi-grams and tri-grams) in a sizable portion of the corpus a hand.  This info can drive the design of the classifier by allowing to allocate the most effort and the most rigid rules to the most common patterns. \nmanually introduce a short dictionary which associates the most popular words with:\n\ntheir POS function (mostly a binary matter here: i.e. nouns vs. modifiers and other non-nouns.\ntheir synonym root [if applicable]\ntheir class [if applicable]\n\nIf the pattern holds for most of the input text,  consider using the last word before the end of text or before the first comma as the main key to class selection.\nIf the pattern doesn't hold,  just give more weight to the first and to the last word.\nconsider a first pass where the text is re-written with the most common bi-grams replaced by a single word (even an artificial code word) which would be in the dictionary\nconsider also replacing the most common typos or synonyms with their  corresponding synonym root.  Adding regularity in the input helps improve precision and also help making a few rules \/ a few entries in the dictionary have a big return on precision.\nfor words not found in dictionary, assume that words which are mixed with numbers and\/or preceded by numbers are modifiers, not nouns.   Assume that the \nconsider a two-tiers classification whereby inputs which cannot be plausibly assigned a class are put in the \"manual pile\" to prompt additional review which results in additional of rules and\/or dictionary entries.  After a few iterations the classifier should require less and less improvements and tweaks.\nlook for non-obvious features.  For example some corpora are made from a mix of sources but some of the sources, may include particular regularities which help identify the source and\/or be applicable as classification hints.  For example some sources may only contains say uppercase text (or text typically longer than 50 characters,  or truncated words at the end etc.)\n\nI'm afraid this answer falls short of providing Python\/NLTK snippets as a primer towards a solution, but frankly such simple NLTK-based approaches are likely to be disappointing at best.  Also, we should have a much bigger sample set of the input text to guide the selection of plausible approaches, include ones that are based on NLTK or NLP techniques at large.\n    "}

If one class dominates the dataset, then the model will be biased to learn that class better because the loss is mainly determined by the model's performance on that dominant class.\nLet's consider an extreme case where the dataset contains 99 percent positive samples. If a model just predicts 1 for every sample, it will have 99 percent accuracy. The idea behind class weights is that you want every sample to contribute to the loss equally. Therefore, you should compute this ratio based on your training set because the loss is computed on your training set. Your model has no idea about the samples that you dropped.\nIf you make a correct prediction, the loss is 0, and otherwise not. Coming to your case, to make sure that every sample contributes to the loss equally, a false prediction for the minority class should be penalized 4 times more than a false prediction for the majority class. So that, the model can not ignore a certain class or have a bias towards the majority class.\nIt is generally a good idea to set the class weight anti-proportional to the number of samples you have for that particular class. So, in your case, that would be 4. However, in practice, you should probably try out few different values to find the best weights.\nAnother important aspect is the ratio of these samples in the wild. You said that you made down-sampling, if the ratio of classes differs in the wild compared to your training dataset, then you might observe worse scores when you deploy your model or when you are testing it on unseen samples. That is why you should ideally also split your validation and test sets with realistic ratios using your domain knowledge\n    "}

You use the same graph as for training the network, but instead of optimizing w.r.t. the parameters of the network, you optimize w.r.t the input (which has to be a variable with the shape of your input image). Your optimization target is the negative (because you want to maximize, but TF optimizers minimize) logit of your target class.

You can't really guarantee that the output of a neural network never violates such hard constraints in general, especially at test time.\nHere's what you could do:\n\nAdd a loss term, something like max(0, (a+b)\/2 - 10). This will not guarantee that your constraint is not violated (the optimization of the NN is \"best-effort\"). This loss function is btw very similar to the hinge loss used in support vector machines.\nUse an appropriate activation function. E.g. if you know your data must lie between [0, 1], use the sigmoid activation on the output.\n\"Project\" the output back to the allowed range if it is outside of it.\n\nWhile the last two options guarantee feasibility, it is not always possible to do that or it is not clear how to do it and - even worse - how this will affect the learning. For example, if you see that (a+b)\/2 >= 10 what will you do? Will you decrease b until the constraint is fulfilled, or both trade-off a and b somehow?

I will attempt to explain what I'm trying to do:\nMy desired output is a raster image, whose values represent lake depth, call it depth.tif. I have a series of raster images, each representing the reflectance values in different Landsat bands, say [B1.tif, B2.tif, ..., B7.tif] that I want to use as my independent variables to predict lake depth.\nFor my training data, I have a shapefile of ~6000 points of known lake depth. To create a tree, I extracted the corresponding reflectance values for each of those points, then exported that to a table. I then used that table in weka, a machine-learning software, to create a 600-branch regression tree that would predict depth values based on the set of reflectance values. But because the tree is so large, I can't write it in python manually. I ran into the python-weka-wrapper module so I can use weka in python, but have gotten stuck with the whole raster part. Since my data has an extra dimension (if converted to array, each independent variable is actually a set of ncolumns x nrows values instead of just a row of values, like in all of the examples), I don't know if it can do what I want. In all the examples for the weka-python-wrapper, I can't find one that deals with spatial data, and I think this is what's throwing me off.\nTo clarify, I want to use the training data (which is a point shapefile\/table right now but can- if necessary- be converted into a raster of the same size as the reflectance rasters, with no data in all cells except for the few points I have known depth data at), to build a regression tree that will use the reflectance rasters to predict depth. Then I want to apply that tree to the same set of reflectance rasters, in order to obtain a raster of predicted depth values everywhere.\nI realize this is confusing and I may not be doing the best job at explaining. I am open to other options besides just trying to implement weka in python, such as sklearn, as long as they are open source. My question is, can what I described be done? I'm pretty sure it can, as it's very similar to image classification, with the exception that the target values (depth) are continuous and not discrete classes but so far I have failed.

Although I developed my own models at the time, I could describe the general process that I went through in order to map the predicted data.\nFor the training data, I was able to extract the LandSat values (in addition to other properties) for the spatial points where known soil samples were taken.  This way, I could use the LandSat data as inputs for predicting the environmental data.  A part of this data would also be reserved for testing to confirm that the trained models were not overfitting to training data and that it predicted the outputs well.\nOnce this process was completed, it would be possible to map the desired area by getting the spatial information at each point of the desired area (matching the resolution of the desired image).  From there, you should be able to input these LandSat factors into the model for prediction and the output used to map the predicted depth.  You could likely just use Weka in this case to predict all of the cases, then use another tool to build the map from your estimates.\nI believe I whipped up some code long ago to extract each of my required factors in ArcGIS, but it's been a while since I did this.  There should be some good tutorials out there that could help you in that direction.\nI hope this helps in your particular situation.\n    "}

I know that the activation functions are used to calculate the output of each layer of a neural network, based on mathematical functions. However, when searching about layers, I can't find synthetic and easy-to-read information for a beginner in deep learning. \nThere's a keras documentation, but I would like to know synthetically:\n\nwhat are the most common layers used to create a model (Dense, Flatten, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, ...).\nIn which case to use each of them? (Classification, regression, other)\nwhat is the appropriate way to use each layer depending on each case?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Depending on the problem you want to solve, there are different activation functions and loss functions that you can use.\n\nRegression problem: You want to predict the price of a building. You have N features. Of course, the price of the building is a real number, therefore you need to have mean_squared_error as a loss function and a linear activation for your last node. In this case, you can have a couple of Dense() layers with relu activation, while your last layer is a Dense(1,activation='linear').\nIn between the Dense() layers, you can add Dropout() so as to mitigate the overfitting effect(if present).\nClassification problem: You want to detect whether or not someone is diabetic while taking into account several factors\/features. In this case, you can use again stacked Dense() layers but your last layer will be a Dense(1,activation='sigmoid'), since you want to detect whether a patient is or not diabetic. The loss function in this case is 'binary_crossentropy'. In between the Dense() layers, you can add Dropout() so as to mitigate the overfitting effect(if present).\nImage processing problems: Here you surely have stacks of [Conv2D(),MaxPool2D(),Dropout()]. MaxPooling2D is an operation which is typical for image processing and also some natural language processing(not going to expand upon here). Sometimes, in convolutional neural network architectures, the Flatten() layer is used. Its purpose is to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps into 1D vector whose dimension is equal to the total number of elements within the entire feature map depth. For example, if you had a matrix of [28,28], flattening it would reduce it to (1,784), where 784=28*28.\n\nAlthough the question is quite broad and maybe some people will vote to close it, I tried to provide you a short overview over what you asked. I recommend that your start learning the basics behind neural networks and then delve deeper into using a framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.\n    "}

{"text":"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n    Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\n    Today Date: 1 January 2025\n\n    You are a helpful ML assistant\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>I am taking intro to ML on Coursera offered by Duke, which I recommend if you are interested in ML. The instructors of this course explained that \"We typically include nonlinearities between layers of a neural network.There's a number of reasons to do so.For one, without anything nonlinear between them, successive linear transforms (fully connected layers) collapse into a single linear transform, which means the model isn't any more expressive than a single layer. On the other hand, intermediate nonlinearities prevent this collapse, allowing neural networks to approximate more complex functions.\" I am curious that, if I apply ReLU, aren't we losing information since ReLU is transforming every negative value to 0? Then how is this transformation more expressive than that without ReLU?\nIn Multilayer Perceptron, I tried to run MLP on MNIST dataset without a ReLU transformation, and it seems that the performance didn't change much (92% with ReLU and 90% without ReLU). But still, I am curious why this tranformation gives us more information rather than lose information.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>the first point is that without nonlinearities, such as the ReLU function, in a neural network, the network is limited to performing linear combinations of the input. In other words, the network can only learn linear relationships between the input and output. This means that the network can't approximate complex functions that are not linear, such as polynomials or non-linear equations.\nConsider a simple example where the task is to classify a 2D data point as belonging to one of two classes based on its coordinates (x, y). A linear classifier, such as a single-layer perceptron, can only draw a straight line to separate the two classes. However, if the data points are not linearly separable, a linear classifier will not be able to classify them accurately. A nonlinear classifier, such as a multi-layer perceptron with a nonlinear activation function, can draw a curved decision boundary and separate the two classes more accurately.\nReLU function increases the complexity of the neural network by introducing non-linearity, which allows the network to learn more complex representations of the data. The ReLU function is defined as f(x) = max(0, x), which sets all negative values to zero. By setting all negative values to zero, the ReLU function creates multiple linear regions in the network, which allows the network to represent more complex functions.\nFor example, suppose you have a neural network with two layers, where the first layer has a linear activation function and the second layer has a ReLU activation function. The first layer can only perform a linear transformation on the input, while the second layer can perform a non-linear transformation. By having a non-linear function in the second layer, the network can learn more complex representations of the data.\nIn the case of your experiment, it's normal that the performance did not change much when you removed the ReLU function, because the dataset and the problem you were trying to solve might not be complex enough to require a ReLU function. In other words, a linear model might be sufficient for that problem, but for more complex problems, ReLU can be a critical component to achieve good performance.\nIt's also important to note that ReLU is not the only function to introduce non-linearity and other non-linear activation functions such as sigmoid and tanh could be used as well. The choice of activation function depends on the problem and dataset you are working with.\n    "}

In slicing, : simply means taking all elements of the dimension. So by using one :, we take all elements of dimension 0 and then \"move on\" to dimension 1.

It is only in this sense that I am interested in the question. Base on the comments so far, my sense is that this is not the case.\nEDIT:\nFor instance, here is a pattern: If x = {1, 2, 3} the len(x * y) comprehensions is equal to 9 provided y[1] = or > 3. For example, len({x * y for x in {1, 2, 3} for y in {1111, 1112, 1113}}) = 9. So tentatively, length = length(x) * length(y), provided there is no overlap in the elements of x and y. Does it work with 4-element sets? Sure: len({x * y for x in {1, 2, 3, 4} for y in {1111, 1112, 1113, 1114}}) = 16. In fact, the integers don't need to be consecutive, just not overlap: len({x*y for x in {11,2,39} for y in {3,4,5}}) = 9. \nAnd, yes, it doesn't work... Check this out:\n{x * y for x in {0, 1, 3} for y in {36, 12, 4}} = {0, 4, 12, 36, 108}\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>No, this is impossible with just the length of the inputs. You can use math to determine the length by computing common prime factors, but the work involved would not improve upon just computing the results and taking the len of that, and it requires knowledge of the set contents, not just their length.\nAfter all, with just the length, {2, 3} multiplied with {2, 3} (producing {4, 6, 9}) couldn't be distinguished from {2, 3} multiplied with {10, 11}, which would produce entirely unique outputs (four total). Makes for a simple proof by contradiction; knowing the input lengths alone is insufficient to determine the length of the output, no single operation on (2, 2) can possibly produce both 3 and 4 without additional inputs.\n    "}

All the examples that I have seen so far for buiding a CNN model are using either just one dataset in pandas or using several images of the same size. So the question would be, Can I use my data for creating a CNN model in this fashion? If yes, Can anyone give me some tricks or\/and tips of how to?\nThanks a lot in advance!\nI have seen some Tensorflow or PyTorch examples but I dont know how to use them with my data\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>It depends on the reason that the data are separated in different files in the first place and what you want to achieve.\nIf each file contains observations for a different entity AND you want to predict observations about EACH specific known entity, you can build a model for each entity. In this case, the entities with more training data will of course have better results.\nStill, if the difference between those entities can be described with numerical values, depending on the exact problem, you can also try adding those to the training data and then concatenating everything. In this case, the added features will make the final classification to better classify the observations of each different entity without building 100 models. Note however that this could work only if the \"qualities\" of the entities actually affect the observations in some degree, otherwise (if the observations are randomly distributed amongst the entities) the results will probably be worse.\nIf however the observations of different entities are needed to train a model that works for any entity (including unknown ones), the data can be concatenated to a single table (pandas DataFrames were mentioned in the question) and then train your model with this combined dataset.\n    "}

I am using the Keras ImageDataGenerator for this. The images are augmented in each batch and then the model is trained on these images.\nI am comparing different models, but since the images are augmented on the fly, is this really fair, since each models is getting slightly different images?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If I understand you correct you are wondering whether the randomness caused by the data augmentation affects the result?\nThe randomness of the augmentation does not affect the result (at least not to a degree that makes a difference anyway) if you train long enough. The other options you have are (as I think about it):\n\nAugment your data deterministically applying the same transformation to your images before inserting them to your model. Those transformation could be (a) either random ones, e.g. rotate your images by a random degree between some limits, or (b) predetermined ones, e.g. rotate all your images by 1, 3 and 5 degrees.\nDon't augment your data at all. Use your initial data to train your model.\n\nThe effect of those choices are:\n\nThe number of transformation you would apply is limited and even if choice 1a is chosen would be predefined set. If you are willing to increase this dramatically other issues arise like where are you going to store all this data, how are you going to handle it during training etc. So, on the fly has the advantage that the storage of your data does not change, neither is the way you deal with your data. The disadvantage of course being a slower procedure is used (which depending on the transformation could make quite a difference).\nThis choice to be valid means that you have a lot of data. And by meaning a lot (depending on the problem of course) sometimes a lot is not enough. Since your are (probably) using different data for testing differences appear between your training and testing data in many aspects. For example for human detection (arbitrary choice) differences in poses, colors, light conditions, image clarity, image size, aspect ratio are common. How do you deal with that? You either collect a super huge collection of data or (probably) use data augmentation, right?\n\nTo sum it up, it's fair because on the long run it does not make a big difference. Consider the option of early stopping for your model for example. Is it fair to compare models that have stopped their training not in the best iteration? Well, it's not completely fair but it does not make a difference.\n    "}

If you use string_input_producer for your filenames and batch for batching, you will have 2 queues - filename queue, and prefetching queue created by batch. Queue created by batch has default capacity of 32, controlled by batch(...,capacity=) argument, therefore it can prefetch up to 32 images. If you follow outline in TensorFlow official howto's, processing examples (everything after batch) will happen in main Python thread, whereas filling up the queue will happen in threads created\/started by batch\/start_queue_runners, so prefetching new data and running prefetched data through the network will occur concurrently, blocking when the queue gets full or empty.\n    "}
{"text":"<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\n    Cutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\n    Today Date: 1 January 2025\n\n    You are a helpful ML assistant\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>Before I ask the question, let me preface this by stating that this question has been answered in many articles, but I still struggle to understand the basic format of word embeddings. \nLet's start with the sentence \"I like dogs\". Assuming a simple hashing approach, \"I like dogs\" can be represented in the vector [1, 4, 6] where the elements of the vector correspond to the hash of each word (assuming these aren't the only words in the vocabulary). From what I understand, this vector is fed into an embedding layer which adds an extra embedding dimension onto the input tensor of the RNN (doesn't have to be vanilla RNN).\nThe embedding tensor (with lets say an embedding dimension of 2) will look something like this for a single entry in the batch:\n[[4.55, 6.78], -> I \n[3.12, 8.17],  -> like\n[1.87, 10.95]] -> dogs\nThis tensor has the shape (1, 3, 2). Does the length of the second axis (3 in this case) always equal the length of the input vector and therefore represent each individual word in the sequence or do I have a fundamental misconception of how the tensorflow embeddings work?\nTo clarify: say I had a much longer sentence with 600 words, would each word after embedding be remembered in their original order and be represented by a vector of whatever size was chosen for the embedding dimension (we'll say 15), thus making the shape of the embedded tensor (batch_size, 600, 15)?\nNote: these are just random numbers and don't represent anything in particular.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>Yes and yes. So, if you have \"I\" [4.55, 6.78], \"like\" [3.12, 8.17], and \"dogs\" [1.87, 10.95], each embedded representation roughly equates directly to each word, and thus the order isn't lost when the embedding is done. And yes, the shape would be (batch_size, 600, 15) for batches of 600-word-sentences and embedding dimension 15. I think the question you're indirectly asking is something like \"Does each word directly correlate to a single embedding vector of length embedding_dimension?\" aka \"Does 'I' directly correlate to [4.55, 6.78] independent of the other words\/embedding vectors?\" For the most part, the answer is yes.\nFor what it's worth, it's been useful to think of it like languages. Doing a hash representation (excluding the duplicate values) or a categorical column with a unique value for each word is somewhat akin to how classic Chinese is, with a unique character for every word. Whereas embedded representations are more akin to the English language, with a \"word\" being a fixed number (embedding dimension) of letters (floats). The advantage is similar to how we gain advantages in the English language. For example \"dog\" vs \"dogs\" has 3 similar characters because they are very related concepts. Similarly, you can take advantage of embedding by representing \"dog\" as [1.23 4.56 7.89 1.12] and \"dogs\" as [1.23 4.56 7.89 9.87] or some such.\nRandom but I hope this helped.

However, it requires building a matrix A(x) and finding its eigenvalues, and is therefore time-consuming. It is expected to have between 0 and 10 roots on [a,b], whose position is completely arbitrary.

That would give all roots. It can find eigenvalues symbolically if necessary.\nFinding all extrema is the same as finding all roots of the derivative of your function, so it won't be any easier than finding all roots (as WarrenWeckesser mentioned).\nFinding all roots numerically will require using knowledge about the function. As a simple example, say you knew some minimum spacing between roots. You could try to recursively partition the interval and find roots in each. Stop after finding the maximum number of roots. But if the spacing is small, this could require many function evaluations (e.g. in the worst case when there are zero roots). The more constraints you can impose, the more you can cut down on function evaluations.\n    "}

For the sake of this answer, I'll assume a uniform distribution.\nThe straightforward way to handle an arbitrary volume uniform distribution is to choose three uniformly random numbers as coordinates in the range of the bounding rectilinear solid enclosing your volume, then check to see if the chosen coordinate lies within the volume. If the coordinate is not within the volume, discard it and generate a new one.\nIf this is not sufficient, due to its non-constant performance or whatever other reason, you'll need to constrain your problem (say, to only tetrahedra) and do a bunch of calculus to compute the necessary random distributions and model the dependencies between the axes.\nFor example, you could start with the x axis and integrate the area of the intersecting shapes between the volume and the plane where x = t. This will give you a function p(x) which, when normalized, is the probability density function along the X axis. (If you want nonuniform distribution, you need to put that in the integrated function, too.)\nThen you need to do another set of integrals to determine p(y|x0), the probability distribution function on the Y axis given the chosen x coordinate. Finally, you'll need to determine p(z|x0,y0), the probability distribution function on the z axis.\nOnce you have all this, you need to use whatever random number algorithm you have to choose random numbers in these distributions: first choose x0 from p(x), then use that to choose y0 from p(y|x0), then use those to choose z0 from p(z|x0,y0), and you'll have your result (x0, y0, z0).\n\nThere are various algorithms to determine if a point is outside a volume, but a simple one could be:\n\nFor each polygon face:\n\nCompute its characteristic planes.\n\nUse cross product to compute plane normals.\nOne vertex of the face and the plane normal are sufficient to define the plane.\nRemember the right-hand rule and choose the points so that the plane normal consistently points into or out of the polyhedron.\n\nCheck that the random point lies on the \"inside\" half-space of that plane.\n\nA half-space is the set of all points on one side of the plane.\nCompute the vector from the plane vertex to the random point.\nCompute the dot product between the plane normal and this vector.\n\n\nIf you defined the plane normals to point out of the polyhedron, then all dot products must be negative.\nIf you defined the plane normals to point into the polyhedron, then all dot products must be positive.\n\nNote that you only have to recompute characteristic planes when the volume moves, not for each random point.\nThere are probably much better algorithms out there, and their discussion is outside the scope of this question and answer. This algorithm is what I could come up with with no research, and is probably as good as a bubble sort.\n    "}

Then in RStudio you can read that file back in.  Look at the R packages rJython and rPython for ways in which you could trigger the python commands from R.\nAlternatively, you could write a simple python script to load your data in Python (probably using one of the R packages noted above) and write a formatted data stream to stdout.  Then that entire system call to the script (including the argument that specifies your pickle) can use used as an argument to fread in the R package data.table.

A predict statement doesn't just 'search and return' results from training data. That's not how machine learning works at all. The whole reason that you build models and have a train and test dataset is to ensure you have a model that is generalizable (i.e. can be used to make predictions on unseen data, assuming the observation is coming from the same underlying distribution that the model is trained on)\nIn your specific case, you are using a DateTime variable an independent, which means you should refrain from using variable such as year, which are non-recurring since you can use it to make predictions about the future (model learns patterns in 2019 but 2020 may be out of its vocabulary and thus years after that are not feasible to use for predictions.)\nInstead, you should engineer some features from your DateTime variable and use recurring variables which may show reveal some patterns in the dependent variable. These variables are like days of the week, months, seasons, hours of the day. Depending on what your dependent variable is, you can surely find some patterns in these.\nAll of this totally depends on what you are trying to model and what is the goal of the model.predict() w.r.t your problem statement.

Then some data pipeline will populate these data to some database. Another pipeline will send these data to predict service.\nI only have training and validation csv files as of now. I'm planning to simulate the flow to send data to predict service following way:\nDAG1 - Every 2 min, select some files randomly from a specific path and update the timestamp of those files. Later, I may chose to add a random delay after the start node.\nDAG2 - FileSensor pokes every 3 min. If it finds subset of files with modified timestamp, it should pass those to subsequent stages to eventually run the predict service.\nIt looks to me if I use FileSensor as-is, I can't achieve it. I'll have to derive from FileSensor class (say, MyDirSensor), check the timestamp of all the files - select the ones which are modified after the last successful poke and pass those forward.\nIs my understanding correct? If yes, for last successful poke timestamp, can I store in some variable of MyDirSensor? Can I push\/pull this data to\/from xcom? What will be task-id in that case? Also, how to pass these list of files to the next task?\nIs there any better approach (like different Sensor etc.) for this simulation? I'm running the whole flow on standalone machine currently. My airflow version is 1.10.15.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I am not sure if current Airflow approach is best for this use case actually. In the current incarnation Airflow is really all about working on \"data intervals\" - so basically each \"dag run\" is connected to some \"data interval\" and it should be processing data for that data interval. Classic Batch processing.\nIf I understand your case is more like a streaming (not entirely) but close. You get some (subset of) data which arrived since the last time and you process that data. This is not what (again current) version of Airflow - not even 2.1 is supposed to handle - because there is a complex manipulation of \"state\" which is not \"data interval\" related (and Airflow currently excels in the \"data interval\" case).\nYou can indeed do some custom operators to handle that. I think there is no ready-to-reuse pattern in Airflow for what you want to achieve, but Airflow is flexible enough that if you write your own operators you can certainly work around it and implement what you want. And writing operators in Airflow is super easy - it's a simple Python class with \"execute\" which can reuse existing Hooks to reach out to external services\/storages and use XCom for communication between tasks. It's surprisingly easy to add a new operator doing even complex logic (and again - reusing hooks to make it easier to communicate with external services). For that, I think it's still worth to use Airflow for what you want to do.\nHow I would approach it - rather than modifying the timestamps of the files, I'd create other files - markers -  with the same names, different extensions and base my logic of processing on that (this way you can use the external storage as the \"state\"). I think there will be no ready \"operators\" or \"sensors\" to help with it, but again - writing custom one is easy and should work.\nHowever soon (several months) in Airflow 2.2 (and even more in 2.3) we are going to have some changes (mainly around flexible scheduling and decoupling dag runs from data intervals and finally to allow dynamic DAG with flaxible structure that can change per-run) that will provide some nice way of handling cases similar to yours.\nStay tuned - and for now rely on your own logic, but look out for simplifying that in the future when Airflow will be better suited for your case.\nAnd in the meantime - do upgrade to Airflow 2. It's well worth it and Airflow 1.10 reached end of life in June, so the sooner you do, the better - as there will not be any more fixes to Airflow 1.10 (even critical security fixes)\n    "}

The 0. before it may be from a previous output, or some other part of whatever custom data serialization format it's using.\nThis design is usually intended to make parsing more efficient; if you use a delimiter character between fields (e.g. a comma, like CSV), you're stuck coming up with ways to escape or quote the delimiter when it occurs in your actual data, and parsers have to scan character by character, statefully, to figure out where a field begins and ends. With length prefixed text, the parser finds a field length and knows exactly how many characters to read to slurp the field, or how many to skip to find the next field, no quoting or escaping required, no matter what the field contains.\nAs for what's doing this: You're going to have to check the commands in your pipeline.

The source data file is 8 GB in size and I am trying to use python to carry out my task.\nI have tried to use pandas chunking to read the file into python and transform it into unstacked pairwise indexed data and write it out onto a json file. But this method is eating up my computational cost. For a chunk of size 100x10000 it generates a 200 MB json file.\nThis json file will be used as a fixture to form the SQLite database in Django backend.\nIs there a better way to do this? Faster\/Smarter way. I don't think a 90 GB odd json file written out taking a full day is the way to go. Not even sure if Django databases can take this load.\nAny help is appreciated!\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>SQLite is quite impressive for what it is, but it's probably not going to give you the performance you are looking for at that scale, so even though your existing project is Django on SQLite I would recommend simply writing a Python wrapper for a different data backend and just using that from within Django.\nMore importantly, forget about using Django models for something like this; they are an abstraction layer built for convenience (mapping database records to Python objects), not for performance. Django would very quickly choke trying to build 100s of millions of objects since it doesn't understand what you're trying to achieve.\nInstead, you'll want to use a database type \/ engine that's suited to the type of queries you want to make; if a typical query consists of a hundred point queries to get the data in particular 'cells', a key-value store might be ideal; if you're typically pulling ranges of values in individual 'rows' or 'columns' then that's something to optimize for; if your queries typically involve taking sub-matrices and performing predictable operations on them then you might improve the performance significantly by precalculating certain cumulative values; and if you want to use the full dataset to train machine learning models, you're probably better off not using a database for your primary storage at all (since databases by nature sacrifice fast-retrieval-of-full-raw-data for fast-calculations-on-interesting-subsets), especially if your ML models can be parallelised using something like Spark.\nNo DB will handle everything well, so it would be useful if you could elaborate on the workload you'll be running on top of that data -- the kind of questions you want to ask of it?\n    "}

I need to sort the dataset using one of the 59th variable which is calculated using the other 58 variables. The variable happens to be a floating point number with four places after decimal.\nThere are two possible approaches:\n\nThe normal merge sort\nWhile calculating the 59th variables, i start sending variables in particular ranges to to particular nodes. Sort the ranges in those nodes and then combine them in the reducer once i have perfectly sorted data and now I also know where to merge what set of data; It basically becomes appending.\n\nWhich is a better approach and why?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>I'll assume that you are looking for a total sort order without a secondary sort for all your rows. I should also mention that 'better' is never a good question since there is typically a trade-off between time and space and in Hadoop we tend to think in terms of space rather than time unless you use products that are optimized for time (TeraData has the capability of putting Databases in memory for Hadoop use)\nOut of the two possible approaches you mention, I think only one would work within the Hadoop infrastructure. Num 2, Since Hadoop leverages many nodes to do one job, sorting becomes a little trickier to implement and we typically want the 'shuffle and sort' phase of MR to take care of the sorting since distributed sorting is at the heart of the programming model.\nAt the point when the 59th variable is generated, you would want to sample the distribution of that variable so that you can send it through the framework then merge like you mentioned. Consider the case when the variable distribution of x contain 80% of your values. What this might do is send 80% of your data to one reducer who would do most of the work. This assumes of course that some keys will be grouped in the sort and shuffle phase which would be the case unless you programmed them unique. It's up to the programmer to set up partitioners to evenly distribute the load by sampling the key distribution.\nIf on the other hand we were to sort in memory then we could accomplish the same thing during reduce but there are inherent scalability issues since the sort is only as good as the amount of memory available in the node currently running the sort and dies off quickly when it starts to use HDFS to look for the rest of the data that did not fit into memory. And if you ignored the sampling issue you will likely run out of memory unless all your key values pairs are evenly distributed and you understand the memory capacity within your data.\n    "}

It's thus not possible to simply recompile (most) packages for Python 3, meaning both need to be made available.\nAlternatively, you can use the Python package manager, pip (or pip3).  The catch with this is that some packages (like scipy) require certain compiler toolchains which you might not have installed.\nIt's generally a good idea to stick to either apt-get or pip for a particular machine.

K-means is one of the few cases simple enough to allow a \"prediction\" consistent with the initial clusters.\nNow sklearn has this oddity of trying to squeeze everything into a supervised API. Clustering algorithms have a fit(X, y) method, but ignore y, and are supposed to have a predict method even though the algorithms don't have such a capability.\nFor affinity propagation, someone at some point decided to add a predict based on k-means: It always predicts the nearest center. Computing the mean only is possible with coordinate data, and hence the method fails with metric=precomputed.\nIf you want to replicate this behavior, computer the distances to all cluster centers, and choose the argmin, that's all. You can't fit this into the sklearn API easily with \"precomputed\" metrics. You could require the user to pass a distance vector to all \"training\" examples for the precomputed metric, but only few of them are needed...\nIn my opinion, I'd rather remove this method altogether:\n\nIt is not in published research on affinity propagation that I know\nAffinity propagation is based on concepts of similarity (\"affinity\") not on distance or means\nThis predict will not return the same results as the points were labeled by AP, because AP is labeling points using a \"propagated responsibility\", rather than the nearest \"center\". (The current sklearn implementation may be losing this information...)\nClustering methods don't have a consistent predict anyway - it's not a requirement to have this.\nIf you want to do this kind of prediction, just pass the cluster centers to a nearest neighbor classifier. That is what is re-implemented here, a hidden NN classifier. So you get more flexibility if you make prediction a second (classification) step.\n\nNote that it clustering it is not common to do any test-train split, because you don't use the labels anyway, and use only unsupervised evaluation methods (if any at all, because these have their own array of issues) if any at all - you cannot reliably do \"hyperparameter optimization\" here, but have to choose parameters based on experience and humans looking at the data.\n    "}

Most commonly we use volume, of course. Especially for higher-pitched content (wavelengths smaller than the width of the head) the head itself can block and cause some volume differences, based on the angle.\nBut a lot comes from reverberation for environmental cues, from timbrel roll-off as a function of distance (a quiet sound with lots of highs in the mix can really sound like they are right next to your ear), from moving the head to capture the sound from different angles, and from the filtering effects of the pinna of the ear. Because everyone's ear shape is different, I don't know that there is a universal thumbnail algorithm for what causes a sound to be sensed as originating from a particular altitude for a given angle.

I've realized that there is not a unique solution to this problem (Does anyone how to prove that, given the above, there is an assured solution?). However, I'm hoping that I can at least arrive at a solution to this problem that minimizes the sum of the edge weights or maximizes the number of 0 edge weights or something along those lines (Basically, out of infinite choices, I'd like the most 'simple' graph).\nI've thought about representing it as:\nMin Sum(All Edge Weights) s.t. for each node, the sum of its out-edge weights equals the known sum of these, and the sum of its in-edge weights equals the known sum of these. Additionally, constrained such that all weights are >= 0\nI'm primarily using this for data analysis in Scipy and Numpy. However, using their constrained minimization techniques, I'll end up with approximately 2N^2-2N constraints from the edge-weight sum portion, and N constraints from the positive portion. I'm worried this will be unfeasible for large data sets. I could have up to 500 nodes. Is this a feasible solution using SciPy's fmin_cobyla? Is there another way to layout this problem \/ another solver in Python that would be more efficient?\nThanks so much! First post on StackOverflow.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>The prohibition against self-flows makes some instances of this problem infeasible (e.g., one node that has in- and out-flows of 1). Otherwise, a reasonably sparse solution with at most one self-flow always can be found as follows. Initialize two queues, one for the nodes with positive out-flow from lowest ID to highest and one for the nodes with positive in-flow from highest ID to lowest. Add a flow from the front node of the first queue to the front node of the second, with quantity equal to the minimum of the out-flow of the former and the in-flow of the latter. Update the out- and in-flows to their residual values and remove the exhausted node(s) from their queues. Since the ID of the front of the first queue increases, and the ID of the front of the second queue decreases, the only node that self-flows is the one where the ID numbers cross.\nMinimizing the total flow is trivial; it's constant. Finding the sparsest solution is NP-hard; there's a reduction from subset sum where each of the elements being summed has a source node with that amount of out-flow, and two more sink nodes have in-flows, one of which is equal to the target sum. The subset sum instance is solvable if and only if no source flows to both sinks. The algorithm above is a 2-approximation.\nTo get rid of the self-flow on that one bad node sparsely: repeatedly grab a flow not involving the bad node and split it into two, via the bad node. Stop when we exhaust the self-flow. This fails only if there are no flows left that don't use the bad node and there is still a self-flow, in which case the bad node has in- and out-flows that sum to more than the total flow, a necessary condition for the existence of a solution. This algorithm is a 4-approximation in sparsity.\n    "}

Hash based techniques for near duplicate detection are designed for the opposite intent of cryptographic hash algorithms. Very similar documents map to very similar hash keys, or even to the same key. The difference between bitwise hamming distance of keys is a measure of similarity. \nAfter calculating the hash keys, keys can be sorted to increase the speed of near duplicate detection from O(n2) to O(nlog(n)).

My question is there any method to combine these classifiers in a way to obtain a better result. \nthanks in advance\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>First of all - the idea of training separate models is rather bad. Unless you have very good reasons to do so (some external limitations you cannot ignore) you should not do so. Why? Because you are efficiently loosing information, you are unable to model complex dependencies between signals from two classifiers. Training everything jointly gives statistical method ability to choose which data use when, this way it can model for example - that for some particular types of data it will use one part of the input and for another - the rest. When you build independent classifiers - you bias the whole process, as these classifiers have \"no idea\" that remaining ones exist.\nHaving said that, here is the solution assuming that somehow you cannot learn joint model. In such scenario (where your models are kind of black-boxes which convert your input representation to decision functions) the basic idea is to simply treat them as preprocessors and fit new model on top, thats all. In other words you have your data point x split into feature-vectors x1,x2,...,xk and k different models mi you built previously, thus you use them to construct a preprocessing method f(x) = [m1(x1), m2(x2), ..., mk(xk)] and this is just a single point in R^k space, which can be now fitted into new classifier to learn how to combine these information. The problematic part is that due to your very specific process, you now need new training set to learn combination rule, as using the same data that was used to construct mi can easily lead to overfitting. To fight that people sometimes use heuristic approaches instead - a priori assuming that these models are already good enough and construct ensemble of these, which either vote for classes (for example weighted by their certeinty) or build whole system around it. I would still argue that you should not go this way in the first place, if you have to - go with learning combination rule with the use of new data, and finally if you cannot do any of the above - settle with some heuristic ensemble technique.\n    "}

Even if you process small chunks of data it probably gets buffered. In fact in case of a single execution, if you copy 1st you actually read the same data twice, once for copy, and once the copy for computation.\nIf you execute your script multiple times, then you need to check what is your data troughput.  For example, if you have a gigabit ethernet then 1GBit\/s is 125MByte\/s, if you process data slower, then you are not limited by the bandwidth.\nNetwork latency comes into play when you send multiple requests for small chunks of data. Upon a read request you send a network request and get data back in a finite time, this is the latency. If you make a request for one big chunk of data you \"pay\" the latency limit once, if you ask 1000 times for 1\/1000 of the big chunk you will need to \"pay\" it 1000 times. However, this is probably abstracted from you by the network file system and in case of a sequential read it will get buffered. It would manifest itself in randon jumping over file and reading small chunks of it.\nYou can check what you are limited by checking how much bytes you process per second and compare it to limits of the hardware. If it's close to HDD speed (which in your case i bet is not) you are bound by I\/O - HDD. If it's lower, close to network bandwidth, you are limited by I\/O - network. If it's even lower, it's either you are bound by processing speed of data or I\/O network latency. However, if you were bound by I\/O you should see difference between the two approaches, so if you are seeing the same results it's computation.\n    "}

The problem may be small enough to prove global optimality.\nYou can also try a multi-start approach: use multiple different starting points. This will at least prevent some really bad solutions. Some solvers have this built-in (e.g. Knitro) but it is not very difficult to implement this with a simple loop.\nSLSQP is a local solver. In theory, you could use basinhopping + SLSQP but I am not sure this works correctly with constraints.\n    "}

In other words, there is a small treatment group and a larger control group, from which the observations that are closest to treatment group are drawn. Through this process, we get a data set with the same number of observations for both treatment and control groups. But what if the observations in the treatment and control group are equal?\nI have a small data set with 600 observations; 300 treatment and 300 control. I want to extract observations which are not significantly different with regards to some variables across the two groups of treatment and control. How can I do that?\nIn other words, I have to restrictions:\n1 - I want my two groups to be statistically insignificant with regards to certain variables.\n2- I want to keep as many data points as possible without violating 1.\nI have worked with MatchIt in R but it does not seem to have such option.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>MatchIt has several options to accomplish this. Here are a few:\n\nPair matching with a caliper (i.e., method = \"nearest\" or \"genetic\" and caliper specified). Only the closest units will be paired, leaving the unpaired units out of the final analysis. This reduces your sample size but restricts the sample to a region with a good overlap and often good resulting covariate balance but changes the estimand to one unspecified.\n\nPair matching with replacement (i.e., method = \"nearest\" or \"genetic\" and replace = TRUE). Each treated unit will be matched to a control unit, but control units can be reused, so it doesn't matter how many there are. Matching with replacement can also be used when there are more treated than control units. If no caliper is used, this method retains the ATT as the target estimand.\n\nFull matching (i.e., method = \"full\"). This forms subclasses of all units in an optimal way and then produces matching weights. No units are discarded, and it doesn't matter how many units of each treatment group there are. Any estimand can be validly targeted with this method.\n\n\nMake sure you read the MatchIt vignettes to understand these methods and how to estimate effects using them. They are all explained in detail.\nIf none of these methods are giving you balance, you might just have an inherently imbalanced sample. Weighting methods (available in the WeightIt package) might be a good alternative. You should try many methods of matching and weighting to find the one that yields the best balance while retaining precision and the target estimand (if desired).\n    "}

In order to optimize the parameters of the neural net for the dataset I am using I am using an evolutionary algorithm. Since the package allows me to build a neural net where each layer has a different activation function, I was wondering if that is a practical choice, or whether I should just use one activation function per net? Does having multiple activation functions in a neural net harm, does no damage, or benefit the neural network?\nAlso what is the maximum amount of neuron per layer I should have, and the maximum amount of layers per net should I have?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>A neural network is just a (big) mathematical function. You could even use different activation functions for different neurons in the same layer. Different activation functions allow for different non-linearities which might work better for solving a specific function. Using a sigmoid as opposed to a tanh will only make a marginal difference. What is more important is that the activation has a nice derivative. The reason tanh and sigmoid are usually used is that for values close to 0 they act like a linear function while for big absolute values they act more like the sign function ((-1 or 0) or 1 ) and they have a nice derivative. A relatively new introduced one is the ReLU (max(x,0)), which has a very easy derivative (except for at x=0), is non-linear but importantly is fast to compute so nice for deep networks with high training times.\nWhat it comes down to is that for the global performance the choice in this is not very important, the non-linearity and capped range is important. To squeeze out the last percentage points this choice will matter however but is mostly dependent on your specific data. This choice just like the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons inside these layers will have to be found by crossvalidation, although you could adapt your genetic operators to include these.\n    "}

The Python language is very nice -- with iterators, generators, and functional programming tools that matlab lacks; however, you will have to pick and choose to put together a nice slick interface if you don't like (or can't use) SAGE.\nI hope that helps.\n    "}

To find a suitable threshold you can build the image's red channel histogram and find the valley there. The lowest point in the valley is the threshold that you could use. If there are more than one valley, smooth the histogram until there is one valley and two peaks. You can use a Gaussian function to smooth the histogram. To find the spots from the remaining pixels you can use the labeling algorithm and then find the connected components in the graph that the labeling algorithm produced. Yes, it is simple. :)\n    "}

How can I find out if I can trust a RNG, or how would I spot a potential skew?\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>If they were indistinguishable from to true random begin with, they will be indistinguishable from true random afterwards.\nThe reason is that any correlation or bias that exists among the remaining numbers would also constitute a correlation or bias among the complete set. Therefore if the complete set is good then the subset is good.\nOf course, this would not necessarily be the case if you deleted the numbers selectively based on their value, rather than based solely on their position in the sequence.\nAlso, if the numbers are not good to begin with then they might conceivably be worse afterwards than before. For an extreme example, consider a sequence that consists of 9 zeros followed by the result of a coin toss, 9 zeros and another coin toss, etc. This data source has some entropy (1 bit per 10 values), but if you remove every 10th element then it has none (the remaining output is known in advance).\n    "}

I have separated the week into 21 time slots, three for each time of day (1 is Monday morning, 2 is monday afternoon, etc.). Adherence values will be binary (0 means they did not take the medicine, 1 means they did). I will simulate training, validation and test data for my model. From my understanding, I can use a logistic regression model to output the probability of the patient missing their medication on a certain time slot given past data for that time slot. This is because logistic regression outputs binary values when given a threshold and is good for problems dealing with probability and binary classes, which is my scenario. In my case, the two classes I am dealing with are yes they will take their medicine, and no they will not. But the major problem with this is that this data will be non-linear, at least to my understanding. To make this more clear, let me give a real life example. If a patient has yoga class on Sunday mornings, (time slot 19) and tends to forget to take their medication at this time, then most of the numbers under time slot 19 would be 0s, while all the other time slots would have many more 1s. The goal is to create a machine learning model which can realize given past data that the patient is very likely going to miss their medication on the next time slot 19. I believe that logistic regression must be used on data that still has an inherently linear data distribution, however I am not sure. I also understand that neural networks are ideal for non-linear distributions, but neural networks require a lot of data to function properly, and ideally the goal of my model is to be able to function decently with simply a few weeks of data. Of course any model becomes more accurate with more data, but it seems to me that generally neural networks need thousands of data sets to truly become decently accurate. Again, I could very well be wrong.\nMy question is really what model type would work here. I do know that I will need some form of supervised classification. But can I use logistic regression to make predictions when given time of week about adherence?\nReally any general feedback on my project is greatly appreciated! Please keep in mind I am only 15, and so certain statements I made were possibly wrong and I will not be able to fully understand very complex replies.\nI also have to complete this within the next two weeks, so please do not hesitate to respond as soon as you can!

You can also try implementing K-Means-Clustering for your project. If your aim is to find out that did the patient took medicine or not then it can be done using logistic regression.\n    "}

I am generating random points that should not fall in these rectangles, so what I wish to do is test if the generated point lies in one of the rectangles, and if it does, generate a new point.\nUsing R-trees seem to work, but they are really meant for rectangles and not points. I could use a modified version of a R-tree algorithm which works with points too, but I'd rather not reinvent the wheel, if there is already some better solution. I'm not very familiar with data-structures, so maybe there already exists some structure that works for my problem?\nIn summary, basically what I'm asking is if anyone knows of a good algorithm, that works in Python, that can be used to check if a point lies in any rectangle in a given set of rectangles.\nedit: This is in 2D and the rectangles are not rotated.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>For rectangles that are aligned with the axes, you only need two points (four numbers) to identify the rectangle - conventionally, bottom-left and top-right corners.  To establish whether a given point (Xtest, Ytest) overlaps with a rectangle (XBL, YBL, XTR, YTR) by testing both:\n\nXtest >= XBL && Xtest <= XTR\nYtest >= YBL && Ytest <= YTR\n\nClearly, for a large enough set of points to test, this could be fairly time consuming.  The question, then, is how to optimize the testing.\nClearly, one optimization is to establish the minimum and maximum X and Y values for the box surrounding all the rectangles (the bounding box): a swift test on this shows whether there is any need to look further.\n\nXtest >= Xmin && Xtest <= Xmax\nYtest >= Ymin && Ytest <= Ymax\n\nDepending on how much of the total surface area is covered with rectangles, you might be able to find non-overlapping sub-areas that contain rectangles, and you could then avoid searching those sub-areas that cannot contain a rectangle overlapping the point, again saving comparisons during the search at the cost of pre-computation of suitable data structures.  If the set of rectangles is sparse enough, there may be no overlapping, in which case this degenerates into the brute-force search.  Equally, if the set of rectangles is so dense that there are no sub-ranges in the bounding box that can be split up without breaking rectangles.\nHowever, you could also arbitrarily break up the bounding area into, say, quarters (half in each direction).  You would then use a list of boxes which would include more boxes than in the original set (two or four boxes for each box that overlapped one of the arbitrary boundaries).  The advantage of this is that you could then eliminate three of the four quarters from the search, reducing the amount of searching to be done in total - at the expense of auxilliary storage.\nSo, there are space-time trade-offs, as ever.  And pre-computation versus search trade-offs.  If you are unlucky, the pre-computation achieves nothing (for example, there are two boxes only, and they don't overlap on either axis).  On the other hand, it could achieve considerable search-time benefit.\n    "}

If you do this, you can then set up an extract refresh to read in the UNC path at the frequency desired.\nCreate an extract with the Tableau SDK.\nUse the Tableau SDK to read in the CSV file and generate a file.\n\nIn our experience, #2 is not very fast.  The Tableau SDK seems very slow when generating the extract, and then the extract has to be pushed to the server. I would recommend transferring the file to a location accessible to the server.  Even a daily file copy to a shared drive on the server could be used if you're struggling with UNC paths. (Tableau does support UNC paths; you just have to be sure to use them rather than a mapped drive in your setup.)\nIt can be transferred as a file and then pushed (which may be fastest) or it can be pushed remotely.\nAs far as scheduling two steps (python and data extract refresh), I use a poor man's solution myself, where I update a csv file at one point (task scheduler or cron are some of the tools which could be used) and then setup the extract schedule at a slightly later point in time.  While it does not have the linkage of running the python script and then causing the extract refresh (surely there is a tabcmd for this), it works just fine for my purposes to put 30 minutes in between as my processes are reliable and the app is not mission critical.\n    "}

I cannot find anything in the docs.  Other ideas include using some kind of intermediary color space such as HSL\/L*AB but I don't really know enough about this.\nPlease note that I am ultimately trying to create an 8-bit RGB image, not a 16-bit RGB image.  Simply trying to colorize the grayscale image in a way that retains the original 12-bit data across the colour range.\nHope somebody can help!\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>My first question would be: Why do you need to convert it to color in any specific way?\nIf you are training the CNN on these images, any arbitrary transformation should work and give you similar performance. You just need to convert the training images and input images in the same manner.\nYou could probably just split the 16 bits and put the bottom half in R, the top half in G, and leave B with zeroes.\nIt kinda depends on how black-box this CNN is. But you can always test this by running a few training\/testing cycles with the conversion I mentioned above and then do that again with the \"compressed\" versions.\n    "}

Specifically what I'd like to do is use scipy.optimize.curve_fit on a large array inside a cython function.\nThe data can be expressed as a 2d numpy array (say, of floats) with the axis to be fit along and the other the serialized axis to be parallelized over. Then I'd just like to release the GIL and start looping through the data with a cython.parallel.prange (the idea being then that I can have all my cores working on fitting at once).\nThe main issue I can foresee is that curve_fit does not operate \"in place\"; it returns the fit values of the parameters (and optionally their covariance matrix) and so has to allocate that memory at some point. (Of course I also have no idea about any intermediate memory allocation the routine performs.) I'm worried about how this will operate outside the GIL with many threads working concurrently.\nI realize that the answer could just be \"it should work fine go try it,\" but I'm hoping to get some idea of what to look out for.

For a really good classifier there are several ones that come with tensorflow\/keras and can be easily implemented. If you're goofing around and learning the coding then I'd recommend different architectures because that's going to teach you more functions. If you have a dataset you don't think existing solutions will be good at analysing and genuinely need the best network to solve classify them then unfortunately it still depends...\nHow to decide:\nFirstly decide on the rough order of magnitude for your overall parameter count (the literal number of parameters your model has). For a given number of parameters, architecture is likely to produce the biggest difference in results between representative hyperparameter choices (don't choke your network down to a single neuron in the middle and expect it to be representative of that architecture).\nIts important to compare the rough performance per parameter so you're not giving an edge to the networks with greater overfitting capacity. You don't need to use all your training data or even train to completion, mostly you'll find the better networks learn faster and finish better (mostly). In the past I've done grid searches with multiple trials at each point using significantly reduced data then optimised the architecture with the most potential by considering the gradients of the grid search. Fun fact: with sufficient time you can use gradient descent methods on hyperparameters to find local minima. You might well find that there are many similarly top performing models, all of which should you can tune until a clear winner emerges.\n    "}

I'm attempting to practice neural networks by having my program predict whether the temperature will go up or down on a given day relative to the previous day.  My training data set consists of the previous ten days and whether they went up or down relative to the day before them.  I'm not implying this is an effective way to predict weather, but that makes my problem even more confusing.\nWhen I train the program over 25 days (50 days ago to 25 days ago) then test it on the next 25 days (25 days ago to yesterday) I consistently get 100% accuracy in the test set.  I've added an alpha for gradient descent and have around 60 hidden layers, and if I make the alpha something bigger like 0.7 the accuracy will reduce to ~40%, so I think my testing code is correct.\nAssuming I have a true 100% accuracy, I had the program predict tomorrow's weather, then use that and 9 days of historical to predict the day after tomorrow, and so on until I've predicted 5 days in the future.  I then waited to see what the weather would be and my program was comically bad in its predictions.  I ran this for a week to test, and had an accuracy of predicting the next day of about 60% and after that only around 10%.\nTL;DR\nSorry for rambling the details, but my question is what would cause a neural network to be 100% accuracy in testing and then fail spectacularly in practice?

If there is a strong correlation between two of them, it is possible that one of these two has a negative coefficient in your linear regression.\nFor instance, take the following example where you want to predict y using x1and x2 as independant variables :\n\nLet's say that y is deterministic and follows y = x1 + 2 * x2.\nLet's say that x2is also deterministic and that x2 = 0.1 * x1\n\nThen, your linear regression has an infinite number of possiblity, you could say that y = 1.2 * x1 + 0 * x2 as well as y = 0 * x1 + 12 * x2 or y = 2 * x1 - 8 * x2. In the latter case, although there is a positive correlation between yand x2, you have a negative coefficient in your linear regression. There is no error, nothing wrong.\nThat is why you should not jump to conclusions and say that because there is a positive slope in your linear regression model, that necessarily means that there is a positive correlation between the independent and the predicted variable.

You can also assess the distribution of your data with df.describe()\nIf they are errors, correct them in your dataset and don't delete them.

So, a natural sorting of the eigenvalues (that is intuitive to us) that is useful in PCA, is by size (either ascending or descending).

By load data I mean convert the CSV file to XML and then populate around 6-7 stagings tables in Oracle using this XML. \nThe data needs to be populated such that the elements of the XML and eventually the rows of the table come from multiple CSV files.

Apply some translation rules while loading the staging tables.\nPython script to convert the CSV to XML.\nSQLLoader to load a different set of staging tables corresponding to the CSV data and then writing stored procedure to load the actual staging tables from this new set of staging tables (a path which I want to avoid given the amount of changes to my existing framework it would need).\n\nThanks in advance.

How should they be represented? I couldn't find any documentation about that.\n    <|eot_id|>\n    <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>When you run into missing values on input features, the first order of business is not how to impute the missing. The most important question is WHY SHOULD you. Unless you have clear and definitive mind what the 'true' reality behind the data is, you may want to curtail urge to impute. This is not about technique or package in the first place. \nHistorically we resorted to tree methods like decision trees mainly because some of us at least felt that imputing missing to estimate regression like linear regression, logistic regression, or even NN is distortive enough that we should have methods that do not require imputing missing 'among the columns'. The so-called missing informativeness. Which should be familiar concept to those familiar with, say, Bayesian. \nIf you are really modeling on big data, besides talking about it, the chance is you face large number of columns. In common practice of feature extraction like text analytics, you may very well say missing means count=0. That is fine because you know the root cause. The reality, especially when facing structured data sources, is you don't know or simply don't have time to know the root cause. But your engine forces to plug in a value, be it NAN or other place holders that the engine can tolerate, I may very well argue your model is as good as you impute, which does not make sense. \nOne intriguing question is : if we leave missingness to be judged by its close context inside the splitting process, first or second degree surrogate, does foresting actually make the contextual judgement a moot because the context per se is random selection? This, however, is a 'better' problem. At least it does not hurt that much. It certainly should make preserving missingness unnecessary.\nAs a practical matter, if you have large number of input features, you probably cannot have a 'good' strategy to impute after all. From the sheer imputation perspective, the best practice is anything but univariate. Which is in the contest of RF pretty much means to use the RF to impute before modeling with it. \nTherefore, unless somebody tells me (or us), \"we are not able to do that\", I think we should enable carrying forward missing 'cells', entirely bypassing the subject of how 'best' to impute.\n    "}
